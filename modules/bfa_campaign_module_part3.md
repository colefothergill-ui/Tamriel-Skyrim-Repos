World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth – Fate Core
Module Part 3
Expanded Acts & Alternate Decision Paths
Overview: This section enriches Acts I–IV of the BFA Fate Core campaign with hidden choices and “what-if”
scenarios. These are optional branches the GM can introduce if players deviate from the expected
storyline. Each Act’s expansions leverage canon lore and community speculation, maintaining plausibility
within Warcraft history. The goal is to add flexibility – not to rewrite Acts I–IV, but to offer secret decision
points that lead to alternate consequences. New plot Aspects and twists tied to faction alignment (Horde
or Alliance) are included, so player choices carry dramatic weight regardless of loyalty.
Act I – War of Thorns & The Burning of Teldrassil
Setting: Tensions erupt as Sylvanas’s Horde marches on Night Elf lands. The Act climaxes in the Burning of
Teldrassil and the Siege of Lordaeron. Players witness the war’s savage beginning. 
Alternate Outcome: The Burning of Teldrassil: In the canonical story, Sylvanas torches the World
Tree, killing countless Night Elves and galvanizing the Alliance. As a secret option, the GM can allow
player intervention during the burning. For example, Alliance PCs might mount a desperate rescue
operation in Darnassus – evacuating villagers or dousing flames with druidic magic. While Teldrassil’s
destruction is likely inevitable (the fire was accelerated by Horde shamans and made
“irreversible” ), a daring PC plan could save key figures or a fragment of the population.
Success might create the Aspect “Embers of Hope”, meaning more survivors and a rallying symbol
for the Alliance. In game terms, PCs could roll against a high difficulty to rescue civilians or temper
the blaze. If they succeed with style, the GM might rule that noteveryone perishes – perhaps Tyrande
Whisperwind’s adoptive daughter, Shandris, saves additional refugees thanks to the PCs’
actions. This doesn’t stop the war, but it alters its tone: the Alliance gains a sliver of hope instead of
total despair. Conversely, Horde PCs could secretly sabotage Sylvanas’s plans – for instance,
delaying the Azerite demolishers meant to ignite the tree. This might not prevent the burning, but it
could reduce the carnage. A Horde PC who covertly spares innocents might earn Saurfang’s subdued
respect (he’s conflicted by the tree-burning) yet risk Sylvanas’s suspicion. The GM can reflect this with
an Aspect like “Witness to Genocide” on compassionate Horde PCs – a compel on it may later draw
Sylvanas’s ire if she learns they showed mercy. 
The Fate of Saurfang – Honor or Death: During the Battle for Lordaeron (Siege of Undercity),
Varok Saurfang becomes a pivotal figure. In the primary story he surrenders to Alliance forces,
shamed by Teldrassil. But what if things went differently? If Alliance players find Saurfang on the
battlefield, they face a choice: accept his honorable surrender (as Anduin Wrynn does) or seek
vengeance for Teldrassil and strike him down. Allow an Alliance PC who lost loved ones in Teldrassil
to challenge Saurfang. A duel could ensue amid the blighted ruins. Killing Saurfang here would be
momentous – it wipes out the nascent seed of rebellion in the Horde. The GM should telegraph the•

consequence (“Without Saurfang’s influence, the Horde’s moral compass may falter …”). If the Alliance
insist on execution and succeed, Sylvanas loses an open dissenter but also a potential martyr. The
Horde troops might become even more blindly loyal (removing an internal check on Sylvanas). In
narrative terms, this could delay or erase the Horde rebellion plotline, forcing the war to continue
bloodily until another figure (perhaps Thrall or Baine) rises much later to oppose Sylvanas. On the
other hand, if players spare or even assist Saurfang’s escape, they nurture the rebellion early. Horde
PCs in Act I have a parallel alternate path: when Sylvanas orders the blighting of Lordaeron’s own
walls (sacrificing Horde soldiers to kill invading Alliance), player characters may secretly defy the
Warchief’s cruelty. For example, a Horde PC might rescue a fallen comrade from the blight or pull
Alliance prisoners out of the gas, quietly acting on conscience. This could plant a seed of doubt in
loyalist PCs – a “Questioning the Warchief” Trouble Aspect that the GM can invoke in later scenes
to test their loyalty. It can also earn them a covert bond with characters like Baine Bloodhoof, who
later thanks those who show honor. GMs should note that such mercy might reach Sylvanas’s ears; if
so, a confrontation or a “prove your loyalty” test from Nathanos could occur in Act II. 
Cross-Faction Echoes: Act I’s alternate decisions set up morally grey dilemmas. An Alliance PC who
spares Saurfang or saves civilians might later leverage that goodwill – e.g. letters of gratitude from
Night Elf survivors, or Saurfang remembering their honor. A Horde PC who assists Sylvanas fully (e.g.
enthusiastically torching Teldrassil’s defenders) could receive the dark boon of Sylvanas’s favor –
perhaps a Black Blight Talisman (an Extra allowing one use of the Blight without harm to
themselves). This comes at a cost: it cements their Trouble aspect as something like “ Marked as
Banshee Queen’s Loyalist,” which the GM will invoke in any encounter with Alliance veterans or
dissident Horde. In contrast, a Horde PC who secretly countermanded Sylvanas (rescuing a civilian or
refusing a “raise undead” order) might gain an Aspect “Heart of the Old Horde” (invokable when
appealing to honor and mercy), aligning them with Saurfang’s values. Act I thus can end in multiple
ways: perhaps Sylvanas’s victory at Lordaeron is pyrrhic because too many Horde feel disgust (if PCs
stoked those feelings), or the Alliance leaves Lordaeron more vengeful than ever (if Teldrassil’s
horror was absolute and Saurfang was slain). In all cases, these branches foreshadow Act III’s
coming schism.
Act II – Early War Campaign & Alliance/Horde Operations
Setting: The factions scramble to secure allies (Kul Tiras for Alliance, Zandalar for Horde) and exploit Azerite,
the new resource. Act II includes espionage, naval battles, and the Battle of Dazar’alor. Here we introduce
alternate sub-plots like cross-faction diplomacy and early revelations that could drastically alter the war’s
trajectory.
Secret Diplomacy – Alliance & Horde in Disguise: With the war in full swing, bold players might
attempt unauthorized diplomacy – meeting the enemy to seek common ground against greater
threats. GMs can draw on community speculation that cooler heads in both factions wanted to avoid
total war. For example, Alliance PCs might arrange a secret parley with Baine Bloodhoof or Princess
Talanji. A Night Elf PC who saved Horde civilians in Act I could invoke that goodwill to get a meeting.
This could create an alternate path where a limited truce is explored. Perhaps in the port of neutral
Booty Bay, PCs convene with Horde emissaries (secretly, to avoid their superiors’ ire). Such a scene
would focus on tense negotiation – a chance for skilled social characters to shine. If successful, the
group might broker a localized ceasefire (e.g. agreeing to spare civilians or holy sites on both
sides). This doesn’t end the Fourth War, but it introduces a cross-faction Alliance Aspect on the• 
•

campaign (e.g. “Backchannel Understanding” ) which GMs can invoke to aid any cooperative efforts
in Act III (like the later rebellion). It could also alter an event like the Battle of Dazar’alor: forewarned
by a Horde confidant, the Alliance might evacuate civilians from Dazar’alor before their raid,
sparing innocent lives. Sylvanas would surely resent this lost psychological edge, but Alliance leaders
gain moral high ground. On the flip side, if players fail (or never attempt diplomacy), the war
proceeds with full hatred: no one is saved when the Alliance attacks the Zandalari capital, and
Talanji’s wrath is maximal. 
Alleria’s Mission to Silvermoon (Alliance exclusive): In the canonical lore, Alleria Windrunner
attempted to reconnect with her blood elf roots and bring Silvermoon back to the Alliance – an
event only hinted at in-game but detailed in lore. Act II can include this as a hidden quest for
Alliance PCs (especially void elves or high elves). Alleria invites the party on a covert trip into
Quel’Thalas under the pretense of diplomacy. In this scenario (inspired by the Three Sisters comic
and in-game text), Alleria meets with Regent Lord Lor’themar and others in Silvermoon City. Things
go awry when Alleria’s Void powers interact dangerously with the Sunwell. The module’s Part 2 NPC
guide already outlines this event: Alleria loses control, causing a void flare that alarms the Blood
Elves. Here, the PCs have a choice: help Alleria contain the Void to avoid a fight, or defend
her and battle the enraged Blood Elf guards so she can escape. This decision significantly alters
Silvermoon’s stance. A peaceful retreat (successful Will rolls by PCs to aid Alleria in suppressing the
Void, perhaps) means the meeting ends tensely but without bloodshed. The Blood Elf leadership still
banishes Alleria (as in lore) for endangering the Sunwell, but no one is killed. The PCs earn Alleria’s
gratitude for restraint, noted by an Aspect “Trusted by the Void Ranger”. They also plant a seed:
Lor’themar, while firm, witnesses the Alliance’s genuine plea; he might secretly open to talks later if
Sylvanas falters. Alternatively, a violent exit has Alleria and the PCs fighting through Silvermoon’s
royal guard. They might duel a notable Blood Elf champion (e.g. Rommath or a Magister). The
skirmish ensures Alleria’s reputation in Quel’Thalas is ruined – she’s seen as an attacker, not a
would-be ally. The Alliance team escapes, but perhaps at the cost of Alleria’s conscience (she did
not want to slay her own people). The PCs in this branch gain a Stunt like Void Flanker (bonus to
combat alongside Alleria’s shadow powers), marking them as her capable operatives – yet
Alliance diplomats (and Blood Elf spies) view them warily thereafter. This whole alternate mission ties
into Act II’s theme of “what if we could sway an enemy kingdom?” Historically plausible (lore
suggests some Blood Elves pondered rejoining Alliance under the right conditions), this path could
even lead to an extreme outcome: imagine if the PCs’ actions caused Silvermoon to declare
neutrality in the war. Sylvanas would be furious (Blood Elf troops might refuse certain orders), and
the Alliance would gain a moral victory. GMs might not want to remove an entire race from
Sylvanas’s forces, but they can simulate small effects: e.g. fewer Blood Elf Farstriders harry the
Alliance in later battles because some stayed home, unsure about the war. 
Revelation of Sylvanas’s Intent – The Shadow of Death: In the main story, Sylvanas’s true motives
remain mysterious until much later, but Act II PCs could start uncovering ominous clues. This
expansion is rooted in fan theories that Sylvanas sought to “feed death.” GMs can introduce side
quests where players intercept Sylvanas’s correspondence or dark rituals. For instance, Horde PCs
might notice a pattern: Sylvanas ordering her Forsaken to collect unusual relics (like the Lantern of
Darkness she obtained from Helya in Legion). An observant PC could research this (Clever or Lore
rolls) to learn the item’s purpose – e.g. soul manipulation. Alliance PCs might capture a Horde
informant who rants about “the Lady’s true bargain.” Such hints can foreshadow that Sylvanas isn’t
merely waging traditional war. An early dramatic reveal could occur if the GM is bold: during an Act II• 
23

•

confrontation (perhaps the Stormsong Valley espionage missions or the Siege of Kul Tiran Shrine
of Storms ), the PCs witness Sylvanas personally in action and glimpse her raising slain soldiers en
masse or communing with a sinister specter. The GM can play out a scene where a dying NPC
whispers, “She wants us all to die… she serves Death itself…”. If the PCs pick up on this and share it with
their leaders, it could change the Alliance-Horde dynamic. Anduin might realize Sylvanas cannot
be negotiated with at all – pushing him to more drastic measures earlier. Horde characters, if
convinced their Warchief has made a pact with death, could accelerate plans to dethrone her. In
game terms, uncovering Sylvanas’s dark intent could unlock a global Aspect like “Shadows of the
Jailer” (though they won’t know who she serves, the sense of a greater evil is present). The GM can
invoke this Aspect to spur cooperation (e.g. “even our faction leaders feel the chill of something
more terrifying than war – do you set aside grudges to investigate?”). One potential alternate
storyline: if PCs push this revelation, Thrall could be contacted in Act II rather than Act III. For
example, Alliance spies share intel with Baine – who then secretly asks Zekhan to seek out Thrall in
Nagrand earlier to confront Sylvanas’s betrayal. This would significantly front-load the rebellion story
(Saurfang might escape prison sooner with outside help if Thrall is moving pieces earlier). It’s a
“early rebellion” branch: riskier and premature (perhaps doomed to fail without enough support,
unless PCs really bolster it), but a daring GM could let the players attempt to oust Sylvanas in Act II’s
latter half. If they try and fail, it sets a grim tone for Act III (the rebellion is crushed once, and
Sylvanas grows even more paranoid, maybe eliminating minor dissidents – the PCs will have a
harder fight later). 
Battle of Dazar’alor – Divergent Outcomes: The major event closing Act II is the Alliance assault
on Zandalar’s capital (the raid where King Rastakhan is killed). In the base module, this likely
proceeds as in canon: Alliance PCs join or lead the strike, Horde PCs race to defend. To deepen
agency, introduce alternate possibilities: What if the players’ choices determined whether the strike
succeeds or not? For example, if Alliance players earlier forged a bond with Princess Talanji (maybe
they spared some Zandalari in a prior skirmish or treated a captured Zandalari emissary honorably),
the GM could decide Talanji obtained intel of the impending raid (perhaps via Vol’jin’s spirit or Loa).
That intel allows the Zandalari to prepare an ambush. In this alternate battle, the Horde could win
the day – repelling the Alliance attack entirely. Rastakhan might survive due to PC intervention
(maybe a Horde PC stands at his side against Jaina’s onslaught, or an Alliance PC who has second
thoughts delays the assault). A Horde victory branch would be momentous: the Alliance fleet is
devastated in the retreat, and the Zandalari remain in the fight with their king intact. The political
outcome here could mean no armistice on the horizon – in fact, the Horde, buoyed by victory, might
push into Kul Tiras next (setting stage for a “what-if” Act III where Horde besieges Boralus). On the
other hand, an Alliance over-success is also possible. Perhaps through ingenious strategy a PC
suggests (like a two-pronged assault through both the port and secret tunnels beneath Dazar’alor),
the Alliance not only slays Rastakhan but also captures the Golden Fleet intact. In this extreme
victory, the Alliance gains naval supremacy; Talanji’s Horde reinforcements are crippled. This could
shorten the war – the Horde might be put on the defensive in Act III, with Sylvanas pressed to more
desperate measures (such as considering using Azerite bombs on Alliance cities, a grim escalation).
Encourage players to come up with such plans, and reward or punish accordingly. For instance, if an
Alliance PC proposes bribing a Zandalari harbor guard, a few good rolls might let them seize ships
with minimal fight. The consequences of Dazar’alor’s alternate outcomes carry into Act III: a
thwarted Alliance raid would strengthen hawks like Genn Greymane’s resolve (“We must hit them
even harder!”) and potentially keep the war front and center (leaving less room for dealing with
N’Zoth’s rise until Act IV). Conversely, an overwhelmingly successful Alliance in Act II could incline• 
4

Anduin to offer a peace deal early – maybe even at the cost of Sylvanas’s removal (he might demand
the Horde hand her over to answer for Teldrassil in exchange for peace). That could trigger an Act III
scenario where Sylvanas becomes cornered by her own faction sooner. The key is that Act II’s
expansions allow player ingenuity to shape the war’s midpoint events: secret diplomacy might temper
the conflict, early reveals may reshape loyalties, and battlefield decisions at Dazar’alor can alter the
strategic balance. Through it all, keep themes of morality and consequence – e.g., if players choose
honor over victory (sparing an enemy), let that yield long-term alliance; if they choose vengeance at all
costs, let it haunt them with unforeseen fallout (an enemy’s vengeful heir, a destabilized power
vacuum, etc.). Every choice should feel impactful but also organically grounded in WoW lore. 
Act III – The Rebel Tide & War’s Turning Point
Setting: The war’s strain shows. Saurfang’s rebellion gathers strength (or is snuffed out if prior choices
altered it), internal conflicts peak, and an external threat (Queen Azshara and Nazjatar) forces an uneasy
pause in the faction war. Act III is rich with emotional and political drama. The following expansions give
players influence over how the Horde rebellion unfolds and how the factions respond to Azshara/N’Zoth
emerging.
Saurfang’s Rebellion – Player Catalyst or Saboteur: In the standard narrative Varok Saurfang,
aided by Anduin, escapes custody and sparks a rebellion within the Horde, gathering allies like
Thrall, Baine, and Lor’themar. We provide hidden options for players to affect this rebellion’s
success or failure. For Horde PCs, this likely becomes the defining choice: remain loyal to Sylvanas
or join (even lead) the rebels. The module can treat this as a secret Act III fork: GMs may even
split the party if players diverge (with careful coordination). If the majority of Horde PCs side with
Saurfang, they can become key lieutenants in the rebel campaign. Introduce rebel operations
beyond what’s in the base Acts, such as sabotaging the Azerite arms factories in Bilgewater
Harbor or smuggling messages to Thunder Bluff to win Tauren support. A success example: Horde
PCs might undertake a dangerous mission to free Baine Bloodhoof from Sylvanas’s custody (as
happens canonically, but now the players execute it rather than just following Thrall and Jaina’s NPC
lead). With clever planning (and perhaps help from Alliance friends, if cross-faction ties were forged),
the PCs can replace the canonical heroes in Baine’s rescue. This yields huge trust rewards – Baine
may name the PCs “Honorary Braves of Thunder Bluff” (Aspect that grants leverage among
Tauren). Their direct involvement also personalizes the rebellion: Saurfang could make one of them
his second-in-command, giving them strategic say. On the other hand, if Horde PCs choose loyalism,
the GM should play up the opposite opportunities. Loyalist PCs might be tasked by Nathanos or
Sylvanas with infiltrating the rebel camp or acting as double agents. They could feed Saurfang false
information, leading him into a trap. For instance, a loyalist PC could volunteer to carry a “peace
proposal” to Saurfang’s camp but actually deliver a bomb or an ambush signal. If they succeed
(perhaps a Deceive vs. Saurfang’s Notice contest), the rebellion could suffer a crippling blow: maybe
Thrall is injured or captured in the ensuing ambush, or a chunk of rebels lose faith and desert. This
might delay the final confrontation or force the rebellion to go into hiding until Act IV. Consequence
branches: If players empower the rebellion, Act III might see the Horde openly splinter: city uprisings
in the Barrens or Undercity deserters refusing Sylvanas’s orders (the GM can narrate scenes of civil
unrest – e.g., a mob of Blood Elves in Orgrimmar laying down arms, echoing the sentiment that their
Regent Lord Lor’themar quietly shares: “This dishonorable war must end” ). This can
culminate in an earlier Battle for Orgrimmar (small scale) in Act III, where rebels secure key positions
inside Horde territory in preparation for Act IV. Conversely, if players cripple the rebellion, Sylvanas’s• 
56

position strengthens – possibly leading to a darker Act IV (Sylvanas unopposed internally, planning
something truly apocalyptic). Such a path might even result in an alternate Act IV endgame:
Sylvanas, not cornered by rebellion, could attempt to use Azerite or plague on a massive scale –
the final battle could be Alliance and the few rebels vs. Sylvanas’s loyalist Horde in a much more
brutal confrontation (more on that in Act IV section). No matter what, player choices in Act III
determine the Horde’s soul. To give mechanical weight, introduce a “Rebellion Morale” track
(maybe a Fate ladder or stress track). Each mission the players succeed at for the rebels removes a
“stress box” from Sylvanas’s authority (Aspect “Sylvanas’s Iron Grip” weakens), and each failure or
betrayal does the opposite (filling rebel “stress”, risking their collapse). This makes the war
campaign’s outcome feel directly tied to PC actions. 
Tyrande’s Vengeance & The Night Warrior’s Path: One of BFA’s most emotionally charged side-
stories is Tyrande Whisperwind’s transformation into the Night Warrior to avenge Teldrassil. The
base campaign likely touches on this in Darkshore, but Act III expansion can allow players to shape
Tyrande’s influence on the war. For Alliance PCs (especially Night Elves or worgen close to Tyrande),
consider a scene where Tyrande offers a dangerous pact: She asks the PC to aid her in a
clandestine assassination attempt on Sylvanas. This what-if draws on the sentiment that Tyrande was
dissatisfied with Alliance’s measured response. The PC must decide – do they join Tyrande in an
unsanctioned mission to eliminate the Banshee Queen early? If yes, the GM can run a stealth-
heavy encounter in the Barrens at night, where Tyrande (empowered by Elune’s dark wrath) and the
PC strike at Sylvanas’s caravan or even in Orgrimmar itself. It might be nearly suicidal – Sylvanas has
the Val’kyr and loyalists – but success could truly end the war on Alliance terms. Realistically, killing
Sylvanas in Act III might be near-impossible, but perhaps the PC and Tyrande manage to slay one of
Sylvanas’s Val’kyr or her chief enforcer (you could target Nathanos Blightcaller in this mission). In
fact, there was community speculation about Nathanos meeting an end at Tyrande’s hand (which
eventually happened later, in Shadowlands pre-patch). Here, you could enact it sooner: if the PC and
Tyrande defeat Nathanos in Act III, Sylvanas loses her right-hand man. Narratively, this enrages her
(she might expedite her cruel plans since she’s personally hurt) but also deprives her of a key
strategist. The morale effect on the Horde could be significant – many Forsaken revered Nathanos;
his death at the Night Warrior’s blades could sow fear. If the assassination attempt fails or the
players refuse Tyrande’s call, an alternate scenario could unfold: Tyrande goes alone and is
presumed killed or missing (perhaps she barely escapes, wounded). The Alliance then loses Tyrande’s
leadership for the rest of the war – a blow to Night Elf morale. The PCs might later have to operate
without the powerful Night Warrior aid at Orgrimmar. The emotional weight is heavy: did their
caution cost them a chance at victory or save them from recklessness? And if Horde PCs catch wind
of Tyrande’s plot (maybe a loyalist PC intercepts a Night Elf scout), they could intervene to protect
Sylvanas – leading to a dramatic showdown with Tyrande in the shadows of Ashenvale. A Horde
loyalist facing the Night Warrior would be an extremely perilous fight (Tyrande’s essentially a mythic
boss at this point). GMs could treat it as more of a delaying action (“hold her off until Sylvanas
escapes”) rather than a straight fight to the death, unless the group is prepared for a very high-
stakes battle. In any case, Tyrande’s alternate arc offers a way for PCs to engage with the vengeance
vs. strategy debate. Fate-wise, Tyrande can lend a unique Aspect to the scene like “Blessing of the
Night Warrior” that PCs can invoke for powerful attacks – but every use could have a cost (perhaps
ticking down Tyrande’s control, making her more feral). In summary, this Act III expansion lets the
Alliance PCs actually attempt the bold stroke many fans wanted (kill Sylvanas earlier), with
outcomes that feed into Act IV: either Sylvanas is weakened (lost Nathanos) or Tyrande is sidelined,
etc. •

Nazjatar and Faction Unity (or Division): Mid-Act III, as in canon, Queen Azshara springs her trap,
luring Alliance and Horde fleets to the Nazjatar sea and destroying them, forcing both sides to work
together against the Naga. This event is a turning point that cools the war (temporarily) in the
original story. But we can add alternate decision paths even here. First, consider how willing the
PCs are to cooperate in Nazjatar’s depths. If previous alternate paths resulted in strong cross-
faction ties (say the PCs established that backchannel ceasefire or personally saved members of the
other faction), then Nazjatar can be a moment of true alliance. The GM should play up scenes like
Lor’themar and Jaina agreeing to a joint assault on Azshara’s palace, inviting PCs of both factions
to form a mixed strike team. If PCs on opposite sides already trust each other (maybe they bonded in
a neutral quest in Act II), allow them to formally ally here. They might even broker an armistice
oath: e.g. the Alliance and Horde heroes perform a ceremonial exchange of weapons before battle
with Azshara, swearing that after Azshara is dealt with, they will address the faction grievances
diplomatically. This could become an Aspect on the campaign like “United (For Now) Against the
Darkness”, which any PC can invoke when acting in cooperation across faction lines. However, if the
PCs have been particularly bitter or one side has been wronged without reparations (imagine
an Alliance PC whose family died at Teldrassil and who hasn’t had closure, or a Horde PC whose
people were bombarded at Dazar’alor and thirsts for revenge), Nazjatar might not yield much unity.
Perhaps those PCs refuse to collaborate beyond the minimum. The GM could run an alternate
Nazjatar encounter where a distrusting Alliance PC almost lets a Horde PC drown or vice versa, until
Azshara’s forces attack and force their hand. If someone still refuses to help the other, you could
even have minor PvP conflict amidst the chaos (though the looming threat of Azshara should break it
up). Consequences: A smoothly cooperative Nazjatar means that by the time Azshara is defeated,
leaders like Jaina and Lor’themar have built real trust (as per canon, they discuss that neither wants
the war to continue). This paves the way for peace talks and strengthens Saurfang’s cause (if
he’s alive) because it’s clear the Horde and Alliance can stand together when needed. If players
facilitated this unity (say an Alliance PC saved Lor’themar from a Naga ambush, directly earning his
respect), they might be asked in Act IV to help negotiate the initial terms of ceasefire. Perhaps
Anduin or Thrall invites the PCs to speak during the gathering at Orgrimmar, citing their cross-
faction heroics. Conversely, a fractured cooperation in Nazjatar could lead to a more fractured
Horde/Alliance relationship after. Maybe when N’Zoth rises (if Act IV includes N’Zoth’s emergence),
the factions don’t coordinate optimally because grudges remain. This could translate into a tougher
final battle mechanically (e.g., no combined assault, so whichever faction PCs belong to has to face
the Old God’s forces with minimal aid from the other). It’s a harsher path, potentially even leading to
greater losses (the GM could narratively kill off a friendly NPC during the N’Zoth fight due to lack of
support, underscoring the cost of mistrust). One more twist: The Fate of Queen Azshara. In canon
she’s defeated and then N’Zoth frees her. Players might attempt an alternate call – for instance, an
Alliance PC with a vendetta against Azshara (perhaps a Night Elf remembering Zin-Azshari’s fall) may
insist on executing Azshara instead of allowing her to be taken prisoner. A Horde PC might want to
capture her as a bargaining chip with N’Zoth (flawed logic, but desperation might prompt it). The GM
can entertain these: killing Azshara outright is nearly impossible (N’Zoth’s influence), but if they
attempt it, they could appear to slay her … only to have N’Zoth snatch her lifeless body and resurrect
her as his thrall anyway. The difference: the players think they killed her, which could be a morale
boost (short-lived when N’Zoth’s plans proceed). Capturing Azshara might lead to a scenario where
Sylvanas (if she learns of it via her agents) tries to seize Azshara from the PCs to use for her own dark
ends (since Sylvanas in secret was fine with N’Zoth stirring trouble). This could set up a three-way
confrontation: Alliance, Horde rebel, and Sylvanas’s strike team all converging on the bound Azshara
– a chaotic showdown that could serve as a penultimate climactic moment in Act III. The PCs’
decisions here will heavily color Act IV’s final mood: are the factions war-weary and willing to unite to• 
8

end Sylvanas’s tyranny, or are they still on the knife’s edge of hate, ready to spiral into oblivion even
as the world cracks under an Old God? Either way, by the end of Act III, Sylvanas’s situation will have
changed (due to rebellion outcomes) and the stage is set for the final fate of the Fourth War in Act
IV. 
Act IV – The Final Reckoning (Siege of Orgrimmar & Beyond)
Setting: The Fourth War reaches its climax. Depending on prior events, Sylvanas faces rebellion at the gates
of Orgrimmar, a unified Alliance-Horde front, or in a darker timeline, she stands unchallenged ready to
unleash devastation. Act IV covers the Siege of Orgrimmar (Battle for Orgrimmar 2.0), Sylvanas’s downfall
(or escape), and the aftermath – possibly including N’Zoth’s final threat if incorporated. The expansions
below ensure the module’s finale reflects the players’ choices, with multiple possible epilogues.
Siege of Orgrimmar II – Surprise Twists: In the base story, the rebellion and Alliance march on
Orgrimmar, leading to Saurfang’s mak’gora (duel) with Sylvanas, where she famously shouts “The
Horde is nothing!” and flees, ending the war. We introduce alternate forks to this climactic sequence.
One major hinge is player involvement in Saurfang’s challenge. If Saurfang is alive and the PCs
sided with him, he may ask a PC to stand with him at the confrontation (perhaps acting as his
second, or if Saurfang were grievously wounded earlier, a PC might don his mantle to duel in his
stead!). Consider an outcome where Saurfang was killed earlier (say by a player’s earlier choice or a
failed rebel assault) – who then challenges Sylvanas? It could be Thrall… or a player character. Indeed,
an epic alternate path is to let a Horde PC issue the mak’gora to Sylvanas. This would be a truly
dangerous duel – Sylvanas is beyond a normal mortal’s power, especially with her banshee abilities.
But Fate Core-wise, if the PC has amassed advantages (allies creating boosts, invoking all the honor
and vengeance Aspects accumulated through the campaign), they might stand a chance. The GM
should be clear: victory is not assured and a heroic sacrifice may be required. If the PC wins a
mak’gora against Sylvanas (perhaps striking her down only for her to vanish in a cloud of dark magic,
as her death won’t be “permanent” due to her phylactery-like connection to the Jailer), that is a
legendary feat. The war ends immediately – both factions stunned. The PC earns an eternal place in
history (likely gaining an aspect “Bane of the Banshee Queen” ). This could replace Saurfang’s
canonical sacrifice. Alternatively, if the PC loses or falters, the GM can have Saurfang intervene at the
last moment to take up the fight (essentially putting events back on the canonical track but with
added tragedy that a brave PC almost gave their life). Another twist: If the PCs are Sylvanas loyalists
up to the end, the GM might run the siege from the other side. Loyalist Horde PCs could be among
those defending Orgrimmar’s gates from Alliance and rebel forces. They might be tasked with a
specific objective like assassinating a key rebel (e.g. Lor’themar or Jaina) during the chaos.
Here’s a dramatic moment: as Saurfang steps forth to challenge Sylvanas, a loyalist PC hiding on a
rooftop takes aim (maybe they have a stunt “Deadly Shot” suitable for an assassination attempt). Do
they shoot Saurfang in the back to ensure Sylvanas has no challenger? If they try, the GM could call for
a pivotal roll (Sneaky vs. many eyes noticing, etc.). A success might mortally wound Saurfang before
the duel – shocking both sides. Sylvanas, uncaring, would use the distraction to attack everyone,
perhaps. This could trigger a more chaotic battle rather than an honor duel. For instance, Sylvanas
might unleash her blight reserves on the field in lieu of the duel, forcing Alliance and rebel troops to
scramble for cover (maybe the PCs have to quickly figure out how to dissipate the poison gas – a
Challenge scene using magic or engineering). Essentially, a loyalist’s intervention removes the “clean”
end to the war and plunges it into a messy fight where Sylvanas tries to kill as many as possible
before escaping. This aligns with her hidden agenda (feed death) and gives a very different climax:• 
8

instead of a 1v1 duel, it’s a desperate race to stop Sylvanas from massacring everyone present.
Perhaps Anduin Wrynn or Jaina could nearly die in the blight – a PC healer might need to save
them. If players manage to mitigate the blight (say a druid PC summons a great wind or an Alliance
PC commandeers a Horde catapult to blast away the gasholders), Sylvanas sees her plan foiled and
flees in rage. The war still ends, but with far more horror and with no honorable closure –
something that Tyrande and Genn Greymane will not easily forgive. Conversely, if the loyalist PCs fail
to stop the rebel/Alliance advance, they might witness Sylvanas’s defeat and have to decide: flee
with their Lady (perhaps instructed to meet her at a rendezvous) or beg for mercy from the
victorious Horde council. The module can support either: fleeing loyalists become hooks for future
adventures (hunted as war criminals), whereas repentant loyalists might be grudgingly accepted in
the new Horde under probation. In summary, Act IV’s siege can play out in multiple ways: a straight
duel (Saurfang or PC vs Sylvanas) with a bittersweet but relatively bloodless resolution, or a brutal
battle if things go awry. Always emphasize the emotional stakes – e.g., if a PC has the Aspect
“Vowed to Avenge Teldrassil”, this is their moment to confront Sylvanas or her champions; allow an
invoke for an extra +2 in a crucial strike or a compel that they must challenge her directly. Likewise, a
“Loyal to the Banshee Queen” PC might be compelled to take foolish risks to protect Sylvanas
(perhaps throwing themselves in front of a blast meant for her). These personal stories should reach
their climax here. 
Sylvanas’s Fate – Captured, Killed, or Escaped?: In canon, Sylvanas escapes after her duel, leaving
both factions leaderless but alive (setting up Shadowlands). The module can explore alternate fates
for Sylvanas based on PC actions. If, say, the PCs enacted the alternate path where Sylvanas was
wounded or weakened earlier (e.g., Tyrande’s arrow struck her in Act III, or a PC duel injured her),
the GM may allow Sylvanas to be captured at Orgrimmar. Imagine the difference: Sylvanas,
defeated, is actually seized and brought in chains before a temporary Horde-Allied tribunal. This
could lead to a gripping epilogue scenario – a trial of Sylvanas. The PCs might serve as witnesses or
even judges (especially if they are heroes revered by all at this point). They’d have to decide her
ultimate punishment. This is a morally complex scene: Tyrande demands execution (for Teldrassil),
Jaina and Anduin perhaps argue for imprisonment (no more martyrdoms), Baine advocates for
Horde handling her punishment internally, etc. The PCs can weigh in. If they choose an execution,
one could let Sylvanas actually be slain… but given her undeath and pacts, the GM might describe
her body falling only for her spirit to laugh and dissipate (implying she’ll return via Val’kyr magic –
effectively the same as escape but with a more final “the villain seemingly dies” moment). If
imprisonment is chosen, maybe Sylvanas is carted off to the Vault of Stormwind (only to
mysteriously vanish later – perhaps that’s a hook for a future module). The key is to give players a
sense of closure or consequence. If Sylvanas escapes as in canon, that’s fine – but if players worked
hard to corner her, you might reward them with at least a moment of “we have you”. Another
alternative outcome: Sylvanas victorious. This would be a wild divergence, likely only if all the PCs
were loyalist and extremely competent at eliminating the rebellion leadership. It’s possible (though
extremely difficult) that Sylvanas could win – for instance, imagine loyalist PCs successfully
assassinated Saurfang and sabotaged Alliance intervention (maybe Jaina’s ship was sunk by Azerite
bombs they planted). In that grim scenario, Sylvanas greets a much smaller force at Orgrimmar and
crushes them (she might even execute a captured Baine or Anduin on the spot). If the GM allowed
this route, the campaign tone shifts to a dark ending: Sylvanas retains control of the Horde, the
Alliance is forced to retreat in defeat, and Azeroth’s future is bleak (essentially the “bad ending”
where the next threat will find a divided and tyrannical world). This can still be satisfying if
foreshadowed – it’s the result of many pro-Sylvanas choices. It also sets up potential continuation:• 
9

maybe the PCs become Sylvanas’s dark champions going forward, or if some PCs were against her
and survived, they’d be the underground resistance in a world ruled by the Banshee Queen. Most
likely, though, Sylvanas will be gone one way or another by end of Act IV, and the focus shifts to the
new status quo. 
The Old God’s Last Gambit (Optional Epilogue): If the module chooses to include N’Zoth’s
emergence (the 8.3 storyline), Act IV can extend to address it once faction war ends. Expanded
decision paths here revolve around how the factions unify to face N’Zoth – which depends on the
war’s outcome. In a harmonious ending (Sylvanas defeated, new Horde council formed, peace
declared), the Alliance and Horde send joint champions (likely including the PCs) to assault N’Zoth in
Ny’alotha. The twist could be who leads the charge. Perhaps a PC who distinguished themselves is
asked to wield an important artifact – say the Heart of Azeroth itself (usually Magni’s domain) to
close N’Zoth’s portals. A dangerous decision could arise: N’Zoth attempts to tempt one of the PCs
during the final battle, offering power or the return of something lost (a loved one from Teldrassil,
etc.) in exchange for betrayal. This mirrors Sylvanas’s moral tests but now on a cosmic scale. A PC
might choose to betray, even after all that unity – leading to an ending where although N’Zoth is
defeated, that character perhaps claims the Void power for themselves, sowing seeds of a future
villain (a very non-standard ending, but dramatic). If the war ended contentiously (factions still
mistrustful), the assault on N’Zoth could be split – e.g., two separate strike forces that
begrudgingly coordinate. This could result in heavier losses (maybe Malfurion Stormrage falls in
the fight because the Horde was late to reinforce the Alliance, something players will feel keenly if
they admire him). One alternate ending concept drawn from speculation: some fans thought the war
might conclude with Azeroth’s world-soul doing something drastic (like “silencing” the factions to
stop their fighting, given Azerite is her lifeblood). You could incorporate a poetic twist: at the final
moment of victory over N’Zoth, the titan spirit of Azeroth communicates to the champions – perhaps
granting a blessing that all who fought in this war receive visions of each other’s perspectives. This
could be an emotional epilogue device – the Night Elf PC suddenly feels the grief of a Tauren who lost
kin at Camp Taurajo, the Tauren PC feels the agony of a dying child in Teldrassil’s flames, etc. As a
Fate Aspect, this could be “Truth of the Fourth War”, which, if invoked, prevents any character from
being able to stomach more bloodshed (essentially enforcing the peace with empathy). It’s a bit
mystical, but it provides a cathartic closure, showing that the very world wants this cycle of hatred to
break. Alternatively, if a dark ending, Azeroth might withdraw – e.g., the planet’s wounds
worsen, setting the stage for an apocalypse (a sequel hook where PCs must deal with a dying world).
Post-War Political Outcomes: However the final battle ends, outline the new political order with
player input. In a typical ending (Sylvanas gone), the Horde forms a Council. PCs could be offered
positions or at least influence in it (maybe the PC who saved Lor’themar’s life now becomes his
advisor for foreign affairs, etc.). The Alliance may reward heroes with titles – a PC knighted by
Anduin or given a land grant in Gilneas for helping Genn, etc. If Sylvanas was captured alive,
perhaps she’s handed to Tyrande’s custody – a choice the PCs might have suggested – leading
Tyrande to depart to the shadows to mete out whatever justice (this addresses the Night Elves’
desire for closure). If the PCs brokered strong cross-faction friendships, Act IV’s end might even
include an unprecedented scene: a joint memorial in a neutral location (like Argent Tournament
grounds) where Horde and Alliance honor their dead together. The GM can have key NPCs make
speeches (and even invite PCs to speak). Use this to acknowledge all alternate paths: mention the
saved civilians from Teldrassil (if that happened, Genn Greymane might specifically thank the PC who
led the evacuation, noting “Because of you, some of my people yet live to see this day” ), mention• 
9
• 
10

the ones who chose mercy (Anduin might say the war could have been far worse if not for those on
both sides who showed restraint). On the other hand, if the ending was bitter (say Sylvanas escaped
and many are unsatisfied), the epilogue might be more somber – tension in the air at the victory
gathering, Tyrande outright walking out (as in canon she leaves the Alliance meeting, unsatisfied).
PCs may need to step up to prevent new conflicts from immediately flaring. For instance, a
hotheaded Genn Greymane might snarl that “The Horde should answer for all its crimes” – a PC
with high Rapport could intervene, invoking an Aspect like “Veteran of Both Sides” if they have one,
to calm the anger and remind everyone of the greater threat they just overcame. Fate Core
mechanics for lasting effects: Any special Aspect the PCs earned (e.g. Anointed by the Gilnean King, 
Void’s Embrace Ally, Champion of Saurfang ) can now serve as justification for narrative authority.
Encourage players to narrate how those relationships shape the future. Did the PC with Baine’s
trust convince him to advocate for a formal apology to Night Elves? Did the PC who became Alleria’s
confidant help negotiate a new visit to Silvermoon post-war, to truly reconcile with the Blood Elves
(perhaps leading to the restoration of the Sunwell’s accessibility to void elves under certain
conditions)? These are story beats drawn from lore-rooted what-ifs fans have discussed – e.g., the
idea of Alliance and Horde finally sharing something (like allowing Blood Elf pilgrims at a rebuilt
Teldrassil memorial, and Night Elves at Sunwell perhaps). 
In conclusion, Act IV’s expanded paths ensure the campaign’s end is player-driven and emotionally
resonant. Whether it’s an ending of redemption and unity or one of costly victory and unresolved rage,
the module provides options to fit the tone the play group earned. GMs should choose the branches that
best suit the story the players crafted through Acts I–III. All threads – the Burning of Teldrassil’s sorrow,
Saurfang’s honor, Sylvanas’s treachery, and the factions’ capacity for either hatred or hope – come to a head.
By integrating these alternate decisions, Part 3 of the module empowers the players to truly “fate” (in the
Fate Core sense!) the outcome of Battle for Azeroth. The war began in fire and darkness, but thanks to their
choices, it might end in a brighter dawn… or plunge Azeroth into an even deeper night.
New Warfronts and Sieges
Overview: Expanding on BFA’s Warfront feature, this section details two new siege scenarios: the Siege of
Silvermoon and the Assault on the Exodar. These large-scale battles are presented Fate Core-style,
combining narrative events with mechanical frameworks (Aspects, zones, challenges) to simulate the tides
of war. Each Warfront includes objectives, pivotal NPCs, unique mechanics (like morale and siege
equipment), and branching outcomes for victory or defeat. These can be woven into Act II or III as
additional theaters of war – or used as standalone “what-if” missions. Notably, these sieges draw inspiration
from Blizzard’s scrapped content and community speculations. Data-mined text from BFA’s alpha hinted
at planned warfronts in Silvermoon, Southern Barrens, and Azshara. Fans speculated how a Silvermoon
battle might unfold (e.g. Blood Elves vs. Draenei, with the Sunwell at stake). We’ve taken those ideas
and fleshed them out for the RPG. GMs can incorporate these warfronts to give players epic mass combat
set-pieces with real stakes. 
Warfront Mechanics in Fate: Treat each warfront as a series of connected challenges across
zones (using Fate’s challenge and contest mechanics). There are battlefield Aspects (like
“Burning Ramparts” or “Sacred Ground of the Sunwell”) that PCs and NPCs can invoke or
compel. Morale is tracked via an Aspect or stress track for each side (e.g. “Alliance Morale”
at 3 boxes, “Horde Morale” at 3 boxes). Key events will cause shifts – capturing a point may
give one free invoke on friendly Morale or inflict stress on enemy Morale. When Morale is10
1112
11

exhausted (e.g. the Horde side takes too many morale hits), their forces break and retreat.
Each Warfront description below lists Objectives (the structural goals needed to win), Events
(special scripted moments that occur at certain points or triggers), NPC Roles (major
characters who lead or assist, which the GM can run as NPC allies or opponents), and
Mechanical Effects (Aspects, Stunts, or loot that come into play). We also describe Victory
and Defeat outcomes to inform the narrative depending on who wins. Importantly, these
warfronts aren’t necessarily predetermined – let the PC’s successes or failures on critical rolls
decide the outcome. It’s possible, for example, for the Horde to win the Silvermoon Warfront,
as speculation held that Blizzard originally intended one warfront where Horde achieves
victory. The module supports that variability, with branching epilogues for each case.
Warfront: Siege of Silvermoon
Context & Setup: The Alliance launches a daring offensive to “assault the final Horde bastion in the
Eastern Kingdoms” – Silvermoon City. This is a direct strike at the heart of Blood Elf territory, aimed to
“cleanse our land of their filth” according to the inflammatory Alliance war orders. Lore-wise, this
scenario fits after the Alliance victories in Arathi and Darkshore (since Alliance would then control routes
into northern Eastern Kingdoms). The Alliance assembles a strike force led by heroes deeply tied to
Quel’Thalas: Alleria Windrunner (void-powered ranger and Sylvanas’s sister), Vereesa Windrunner (leader
of the Silver Covenant high elves), Lady Jaina Proudmoore (providing naval/artillery support and portals),
and Arator the Redeemer (Turalyon and Alleria’s son, representing the Army of the Light). The Horde’s
defense is commanded by Silvermoon’s leadership: Regent Lord Lor’themar Theron, Grand Magister
Rommath, Lady Liadrin of the Blood Knights, and Halduron Brightwing (Ranger-General of Silvermoon).
Sylvanas Windrunner, occupied with the main war, is not personally present, but her influence is felt – she’s
dispatched a contingent of Forsaken Dark Rangers (possibly including Velonara or even the raised Dark
Ranger versions of fallen night elves) to bolster her homeland’s defense. The Alliance’s explicit goal is to
neutralize Silvermoon and secure the Sunwell, cutting off Horde access in EK. The Horde aims to repel
the invaders, protecting their home and the sacred Sunwell at all costs. 
Battlefield Aspects: Ghostlands No-Man’s Land, Eversong Arcane Wards, Sunwell’s Radiance. These aspects
highlight key battleground zones. “Ghostlands No-Man’s Land” reflects the haunted, blighted terrain south
of Silvermoon – full of lingering undead from the Scourge; it can be invoked for obstacles (e.g. Alliance siege
engines getting stuck in bone-filled ravines) or advantages (Horde necromancers rouse undead remnants
against Alliance flank). “Eversong Arcane Wards” represents magical defenses (a lingering effect of the
Scourge Invasion ward that once isolated the zone). PCs might need to overcome these wards to enter the
city (a Lore or Magic overcome roll). “Sunwell’s Radiance” comes into play later – near the end, the proximity
of the Sunwell empowers holy magic and repels void. It can give Liadrin or Rommath free invokes to
strengthen Blood Elf resolve, but conversely, it severely hinders Alleria (or any void user) if not dealt with.
PCs could choose to shatter or corrupt that Aspect (e.g. Alleria performing a void ritual to dampen the
Sunwell, a risky move that could taint it). Doing so might make the final fight easier for Alliance (no Sunwell
boosts for Horde), but carries moral and lore consequences (a mini what-if: Alleria corrupting the Sunwell
was a fan theory of how things could go terribly wrong ). The GM should present that as an impactful
choice (“Invoke the void to nullify Sunwell’s light? This could enrage the Blood Elves and scar the land…”). 
Objectives: The Alliance must accomplish three key objectives to win:
1. Break the Gates: breach the Scorched Grove gate between the Ghostlands and Eversong Woods. This
heavy gate is guarded by elite Farstriders and infused with spells (Aspect Enchanted Gate ). The Alliance can13
14
15
16
17
12

siege it (might require creating an advantage like Gate Weak Point Exposed via Sabotage or using Jaina’s
magic to counter the enchantment). Horde PCs will attempt to delay or fortify the gate (perhaps using
Rommath’s glyphs to reinforce it – a Create Advantage action on defense). A milestone event: if the gate
falls, Alliance forces pour into Eversong; Horde morale takes a hit (assign 1 stress to Horde Morale track). If
the gate holds for too long (say X rounds/exchanges), a narrative twist: Alleria suggests a secret path
through the Ghostlands (perhaps through underground catacombs of Deatholme). This opens a
secondary front but at risk – those catacombs teem with undead. The GM can run a quick challenge for a
small PC team to clear that path as an alternative to gate-crashing. 
Secure the Sunwell Isle Bridge: The Alliance needs to cross into Sunfury Spire (the city) and the
Isle of Quel’Danas where the Sunwell lies. The key chokepoint is the bridge over the river leading to
Sunfury Spire. Lor’themar and Liadrin personally lead a stand here. This stage plays as a contest –
PCs must capture three strategic points (e.g. Dawnstar Archery Range, the Bazaar, and the Sunfury
Bridge itself). Each point can be an exchange where PCs face a mini-boss or hazard: e.g., at the
Bazaar, Hundred-Arms Hundros (for example, a hulking construct deployed by Rommath) is causing
havoc – defeat it to claim the area. Or at Dawnstar, Ranger-General Halduron engages the Alliance
in a sniper battle from the treetops (PCs need to flush him out or duel him). Each point secured
grants the Alliance a boost (free invoke on next contest), each point the Horde holds grants them
instead. During this phase, Arator tries a diplomatic gambit: he rides out mid-battle under a flag of
truce to appeal to the Blood Elves. Arator, being half-elf (Alleria’s son), shouts an offer: “Blood Elves!
The Alliance does not wish to annihilate you – throw down your arms and you will be treated with
honor!” This is a persuasion mechanic for PCs: if any PC wants to support this effort (perhaps an
Alliance paladin PC joining Arator to parley, or even a sympathetic Horde PC secretly encouraging
their side to consider it), they roll Rapport or Empathy opposed by the passion of the Blood Elf
defenders. A success could actually cause a portion of defenders (maybe some of the civilian
Sunfury Guards ) to stand down, reducing Horde forces (a tangible effect: remove one passive
opposition or make one upcoming combat easier). It could also plant an Aspect “Doubt in
Quel’Thalas” that Horde leaders must overcome (a compel could have a Blood Knight falter, hearing
Arator’s words reminding them of the alliance they once had with the Alliance in the Second War).
However, a failure (or refusal by PCs to parley) means the Blood Elves fight all the harder – Liadrin
might bellow, “We remember Garithos’s treachery! We will never yield!” and perhaps gain a free
invoke of “For Silvermoon!” on their defense. Notably, if Alleria is present on the field at this time,
her presence is a double-edged sword: many Blood Elves hate her for the void episode. The GM
could have the sight of Alleria infuriate the defenders, negating Arator’s diplomacy unless Alleria
holds back. A PC could persuade Alleria to momentarily retreat for the greater good (a roleplay
moment: Alleria clenches her fist but agrees to step out of sight so her son’s plea has a chance). This
ties into PC choice – do they leverage Alleria’s power or set it aside to help Arator’s argument? 
Confront the High Leadership (Sunwell Plateau): The final objective is either capture the Sunwell
or force the enemy commanders to yield. Alliance troops push onto the Isle of Quel’Danas
(perhaps via portal or captured hawkstrider towers once the bridge is secure). The climax is at the
Sunwell Plateau, a hallowed ground. Rommath and Liadrin make their last stand here, defending
the Sunwell’s chamber. Alleria, Vereesa, and Jaina join the PCs for the final push. Pivotal NPC
showdown: Here the unique dynamic is Alleria vs. the Sunwell. As soon as she steps near, the
Sunwell’s pure Light reacts violently to her Void energy. A tear in reality might even open – void
creatures starting to spill out around the edges as the two energies clash. This creates a major scene
Aspect “Void-Light Clash” that threatens to destabilize the area. The GM sets a timer (e.g. 4 rounds1. 
2. 
2
13

before an explosion of unstable energy occurs that could destroy the Sunwell). The PCs must fight
the Blood Elf elites (say, Liadrin and Rommath as boss-tier opponents) while also dealing with the
Sunwell crisis. Options: they could convince Alleria to withdraw to stop feeding the void rift (losing
a powerful ally in the fight but potentially saving the Sunwell from corruption), or attempt to contain
the energies themselves (maybe a PC mage or priest performs a ritual to stabilize the Sunwell, a
difficult overcome roll). If they fail to address it, the GM might escalate with a dramatic consequence:
the Sunwell starts to darken (potentially becoming a Voidwell!). Historically, fans speculated what
would happen if void corrupted the Sunwell – possibly a disaster where the Blood Elves lose their
source of Light and panic. So a failure could mean even if Alliance wins militarily, they end up
inadvertently corrupting the Sunwell (a very costly “victory”). This alternate outcome would have
huge post-battle ramifications: Alleria would be horrified, the Blood Elves would be existentially
threatened (they might surrender just to get help purifying it, or conversely vow eternal vengeance
for this defilement). Encourage players to care about this – perhaps a PC with high lore knows “If the
Sunwell is destroyed or corrupted, we’ll have another Theramore-level tragedy on our hands, plus
possibly unleash something like M’uru’s fall again.” So they have to multi-task between dueling
Liadrin (who fights fiercely, calling the Light to smite the void creatures) and mitigating cosmic
energies. Persuasive mechanics for Arator: During this finale, Arator (if alive and present) plays a
special role. Seeing the battlefield chaos, he attempts one last time to sway his mother Alleria or
the Blood Elves. For instance, if Alleria is on the verge of losing control to the Void to stop the
Sunwell, Arator could step in and calm her with the Light (he’s a paladin of the Silver Hand). PCs can
amplify Arator’s plea (“Mother, hold on! Remember Turalyon’s teachings…!”) by creating an
Advantage like Arator’s Light Reaches Alleria. One free invoke might allow Alleria to succeed in
containing her void, preventing catastrophe (essentially, Arator’s influence gives Alleria a stunt:
Beacon of Hope – Alleria can reroll a failed Will save against void corruption ). Alternatively, if a PC is of
Thalassian descent (void elf or high elf PC, for example), Arator might collaborate with them to talk
down Rommath or Liadrin. A persuasive PC could directly engage Liadrin mid-battle in a war of
words: e.g., an Alliance paladin PC might appeal to Liadrin’s past (reminding her of when she fought
for the Shattered Sun Offensive alongside Alliance to rekindle the Sunwell ). This could be a
Rapport vs. Will contest each exchange of the fight. If the PC wins, Liadrin’s resolve falters – perhaps
she orders her Blood Knights to stand down, unwilling to see the Sunwell destroyed in crossfire. The
GM could then narrate Liadrin kneeling and surrendering, tears in her eyes, choosing the Sunwell’s
safety over Sylvanas’s commands. If this happens, the battle essentially ends with a negotiated
surrender rather than total slaughter – a major alternate outcome where the Blood Elf leadership
yields on condition the Sunwell is protected. This would be a huge diplomatic victory for the Alliance
(and a relatively bloodless resolution to the warfront). If players fail to persuade and simply
overpower Liadrin and Rommath, the aftermath might be more grim (we’ll cover that in outcomes). 
Notable Pivotal NPCs & Player Roles: The warfront structure assumes players might take on different
roles – frontline assault, arcane support, commanding NPC squads, or even special ops. Key NPCs can fight
alongside or against them depending on faction:
- Alleria Windrunner (Alliance) – Uses her Void powers aggressively to counter magisters and provide
ranged support. She has a stunt “Void Volley” (area attack) but if the Sunwell’s light is present, she suffers
(the GM might compel Sunwell’s Radiance against her to create trouble). PCs can use Alleria as an artillery
piece or void specialist (e.g., ask her to specifically target enemy mages or to track stealthy Dark Rangers by
sensing their emotions). However, they must manage her Void state (perhaps a PC with Empathy keeps
checking on Alleria’s mood, ready to snap her out of any whisper-induced trance).
- Lady Liadrin (Horde) – If Horde PCs are defending, Liadrin can rally them with her aura of devotion17
18
14

(granting a +2 boost to any defensive action once per scene, as a stunt “Blood Knight Inspiration”). She
might assign a PC paladin or warrior to lead a critical counter-charge. If Alliance PCs face her, expect a duel
with a formidable champion – she fights with both sword and Light magic. Clever PCs might exploit her
known Trouble Aspect “Haunted by Past Zealotry” – reminding her of past mistakes (like draining a
naaru for power) to throw her off balance. A compel on that could make her overreact or hesitate, creating
an opening.
- Lor’themar Theron (Horde) – The regent lord coordinates defense. He might not engage personally until
later. Horde PCs could be his messengers or eyes on the field (“PC, take this Farstrider squad and hold the
eastern flank!”). Alliance PCs might confront him in the final phase; he’s a skilled ranger but also a diplomat
at heart. A persuasive Alliance PC could target him for negotiation (“Lor’themar, you know Sylvanas’s war is
wrong – don’t waste your people for her!”). In lore, Lor’themar was considering the Horde’s future and
nearly opened talks with Alliance. A PC leveraging that (perhaps citing the Horde’s blight of Darkshore
or the loss of Princess Theron) might push Lor’themar to consider a ceasefire. If convinced (maybe via a
major succeed with style on Rapport), he could order a retreat to preserve lives, effectively ceding the field
(a sort of Alliance win without bloodshed). This is tricky, as it’s near-treason for him in Sylvanas’s eyes – but if
presented as “saving the Sunwell from destruction,” he could justify it.
- Jaina Proudmoore (Alliance) – Provides magical artillery and possibly portals. PCs can call on Jaina for a
scripted intervention: e.g., if they need to evacuate wounded or bring in a surprise flanking force, Jaina can
open a portal from Theramore’s remnants or Kul Tiras marines to appear behind enemy lines. One event:
Jaina’s presence triggers a personal confrontation with Rommath (lore: Rommath was taught by Kael’thas
who hated Jaina for Theramore and other events). Rommath might focus his spells on Jaina, leaving him
open to a PC’s sneak attack. The GM can describe Rommath conjuring a manavoid to counter Jaina’s
massive Blizzard; if a rogue-type PC takes that moment to knife Rommath in the back (figuratively), it could
tip the scales. Jaina can also counteract enemy spells like an anti-magic shell the Blood Elves might deploy.
Essentially, she’s the ace that can be used a limited number of times (e.g., allow the PCs to request “Jaina,
we need that wall of ice now!” perhaps 1-2 times as a free boost).
- Persuading Arator (Special Horde perspective): The brief mentioned “persuasive mechanics for PCs
trying to sway Arator.” If Horde PCs somehow parley or capture Arator during battle (imagine a scenario
where a Horde PC defeats Arator in combat rather than killing him, they take him prisoner), they could
attempt to sway him. For example, a Horde PC might converse with Arator about the fight – “You claim
righteousness, but look at the void monstrosities your mother unleashes. Is this Alliance justice?” If
successful, they might instill doubt in Arator. He won’t turn on his family, but perhaps he’ll urge Alleria to
pull back at a key moment (“Mother, this is too dangerous. The Sunwell’s sanctity matters!”). This could
weaken the Alliance offensive or at least remove Alleria’s void aid. It’s a subtle way for Horde players to
affect Alliance morale – effectively using Arator’s love for both sides to induce a pause. Achieving this might
require careful roleplay or spending a Fate point to declare a story detail (like “Arator hesitates,
remembering his father’s respect for the Blood Knights during the Second War”). If done, treat it as creating
an Aspect “Arator’s Doubts” that the GM can invoke to have Arator act less decisively on Alliance turns. 
Unique Warfront Stunts & Gear: Each side employs special war assets:
- Alliance Siege Tanks & Flying Machines: The Alliance brought a few siege engines through Ghostlands
(or airdropped by gyrocopters). A PC driver (if someone has a high Drive or Crafts skill) can operate a Siege
Tank with a stunt “Azerite Shells – +2 to Attack an area target (large blast) once per scene” (based on
Gnomish experiments with Azerite ammo). There’s also an aspect “Air Superiority” if Alliance secures the
skies (Jaina likely cleared a path for gnomish flying machines). If active, Alliance PCs can call for an air strike
(a once per conflict free invoke to simulate a bombing run).
- Horde Mana Bomb Emplacements: In defense, the Blood Elves have mana crystal-powered arcane19
5
15

launchers – essentially mini mana-bomb throwers set along the walls. They have a stunt “Arcane Barrage –
create an Aspect Arcane Shrapnel on targets in a zone, causing a free invoke against anyone moving through
that zone”. Horde PCs can man these emplacements to slow Alliance advances. Alliance PCs might sabotage
or seize them (turning the guns around). If a particularly tech-savvy PC (gnome, goblin, etc.) gets to one,
they might jury-rig it to fire an anti-magic pulse at the Sunwell – a wild idea that could disrupt Blood Elf spells
in the final fight (but also risks destabilizing the Sunwell further).
- Void-Touched Arrowheads (Alliance loot): Alleria equipped some of her Farstriders (the Alliance Void
Elves) with void-infused arrows. PCs could recover these from fallen void elf rangers and use them. As a loot
aspect, Void-Touched Arrowheads can be invoked to pierce magical shields or cause fear in enemies (the void
energies unsettle even hardened soldiers). But a compel might have a side effect (perhaps a PC using them
hears whispers or a void ethereal bolt accidentally empowers an enemy undead that thrives on void).
- Shattered Sun Wardstone (Horde asset): Rommath prepared a reliquary from the Shattered Sun
Offensive days – essentially a powerful crystal that can, once, project a dome of holy light around the
Sunwell’s core. This functions as a stunt “Sanctum Sanctorum – Once per battle, negate any one void or dark
magical effect in Sunwell’s area.” The Horde might trigger this when Alleria tries something dramatic or if
Jaina hurls a massive frost nova – the wardstone nullifies it. Alliance PCs could try to destroy or steal the
wardstone earlier (maybe hidden in the city’s sanctum—an infiltration sub-mission). If they do, the Horde
loses that trump card (and possibly the Sunwell’s defenses are more vulnerable). Conversely, if Horde PCs
realize the wardstone is about to be lost (say a rogue PC sees an Alliance saboteur in the sanctum), they can
take actions to secure it, ensuring it’s available in the final moment (like Rommath handing Liadrin the
crystal: “Go, protect the Sunwell!” just before he falls).
- Azerite War Golems: A nod to scrapped content – Gallywix supposedly planned an Azerite war machine in
Azshara. In Silvermoon’s siege context, perhaps the Alliance deploys an Azerite Juggernaut (a dwarf-
driven golem powered by Azerite, akin to a tanky mini-boss). Stats: It could have an aspect “Impenetrable
Azerite Plating” and a stunt Unstable Overclock (take 1 stress to its core to gain +2 to a strength-based
action, like smashing a gate or an enemy construct). If Alliance PCs are lacking brute force, this golem helps.
If Horde players are present, they might have to devise a way to disable the juggernaut – possibly using
arcane feedback (overloading its Azerite with mana – a clever Magic or Tech roll) or exploiting terrain (luring
it onto weakened ground that collapses). Destroying or capturing the juggernaut before it reaches the city
is crucial for Horde victory (it’s essentially the Alliance’s boss vehicle). 
Morale & Events: All warfronts include a morale mechanism. For Silvermoon: start both Alliance Morale
and Horde Morale at, say, 3 each (scale as needed). Certain events adjust these:
- If Alliance breaches the gate in good time, Horde morale –1 (shock and fear spreads among defenders). If
Alliance gets bogged down or repelled at gate, Alliance morale –1 (confidence wavers).
- If an Alliance PC or NPC hero falls (e.g., Vereesa is gravely wounded by an arrow), Alliance morale –1.
Similarly, if a Horde leader falls (say Halduron is slain by Alliance fire), Horde morale –1.
- Successful persuasion like Arator’s diplomacy might directly hit Horde morale (some troops desert =
morale –1) or boost Alliance morale (knowing civilians were spared or a chance of peace = morale +1).
- The appearance of Void creatures from the Sunwell instability hurts both sides’ morale (everyone’s terrified
of void incursion, Alliance morale –1 and Horde morale –1, unless players quickly mitigate it).
- The first side to reach 0 morale suffers a breakdown: their remaining forces start to rout or surrender. In
Fate terms, you could interpret 0 morale as an aspect “On the Brink of Defeat” that the enemy can invoke
freely to represent panicked or disorganized opposition. For instance, if Horde morale hits 0, the next
overcome the Alliance tries to rush the Sunwell has no opposition because many defenders have thrown
down arms. Or if Alliance morale hits 0 (maybe too many losses or failed pushes), an Alliance PC might get
compelled with “Why are we shedding blood here? – Hesitation”, imposing a penalty or a stall as doubt20
16

sets in. PCs can rally (via a strong Provoke or Rapport speech to allies) to restore a point or two of morale if
dramatically appropriate. For example, an Alliance PC paladin might lift the Silver Hand banner amidst
despair and cry “For Teldrassil, for the Light!” to reignite the offensive (spend a Fate point to bump morale
up by 1 with a stirring aspect “Last Stand Courage” ). 
Victory Conditions: The battle ends when one side’s morale breaks or the Alliance achieves its objectives
(breach city + secure Sunwell) or fails decisively (repelled entirely). Here are branches: 
Alliance Victory – Silvermoon Falls (Conditional): The Alliance wins if they capture the Sunwell and
force the Horde leaders to surrender or flee. This could happen with minimal bloodshed (if
persuasion succeeded and leaders yielded) or with Silvermoon in flames (if it was taken by force). A
complete Alliance victory might mean Lor’themar, Liadrin, Rommath are captured. The political
outcome: The Blood Elves are removed from Sylvanas’s Horde. In war terms, this is a massive
Alliance triumph – “the last Horde bastion in EK cleansed”. However, what does Alliance do with
Silvermoon? Possibly occupy it militarily. The GM should illustrate that this victory, while significant,
is not neat: occupying an enemy city is perilous. The module might state that the Alliance gains the
Sunwell but has to assure the Blood Elves they won’t be mistreated (to avoid insurgency). If the PCs
were honorable (didn’t corrupt the Sunwell, minimized civilian harm), Lor’themar could grudgingly
cooperate in the aftermath, perhaps even exploring rejoining the Alliance (a lore-rooted what-if
given he considered diplomacy if Sylvanas was overthrown). If the victory was pyrrhic (say the
Sunwell was corrupted and Liadrin died defending it), then although Alliance “won,” the narrative is
grim: Quel’Thalas lies in ruin, and Alliance must deal with humanitarian crisis (not to mention
looking like the bad guys for tainting a holy font). Loot/Rewards: Alliance PCs might retrieve
legendary items from Silvermoon’s vaults – e.g., the Sunspear (a famed weapon) or a stash of
Arcanist’s Draughts (potions that grant a free aspect “Arcane Empowerment” to use later). More
importantly, Alliance gains a forward base for further Horde invasions (setting stage for maybe a
push into Lordaeron’s reclaimed lands in a campaign). Horde PCs in this outcome face despair – they
likely retreat with any survivors to regroup outside (maybe meeting Sylvanas who is furious). It could
be the moment that triggers Saurfang’s rebellion to double down (e.g., “We lost Silvermoon because
of Sylvanas’s madness; time to dethrone her”). If any Horde PC was captured, there’s potential for an
Act IV rescue mission or tense negotiation (prisoners exchanged). 
Horde Victory – Alliance Repelled: The Horde wins if Alliance morale breaks or their attack fails
(perhaps Jaina is injured and calls a retreat, or the Sunwell’s power outright overwhelms Alleria
forcing Alliance to abort). A strong Horde victory might mean Alliance forces are annihilated or
chased out of Eversong. For instance, if the Horde managed to slay a major Alliance hero (imagine a
scenario where Liadrin, in a final strike, cuts down Vereesa Windrunner – that would shock the
Alliance into pulling back), the Alliance army could collapse. Political outcome: The Horde maintains
Quel’Thalas and claims a major defensive win. Sylvanas would laud this as proof of the Horde’s
supremacy. However, what of Alleria and Arator? If Horde truly triumphed, Alleria might be captured
(a huge twist – Sylvanas’s sister a prisoner). Sylvanas’s reaction would be complex: she might either
use Alleria as a bargaining chip or, darkly, attempt to turn her (imagine Sylvanas ordering Alleria
delivered to the Undercity’s dungeons for “reeducation”). That could spawn many plot threads –
perhaps a rescue mission by Alliance PCs or even a moral test for Horde PCs (are they okay with
Sylvanas potentially torturing her own sister?). If Arator survived but Alliance lost, he might be the
one to ensure his mother’s safe return by negotiating peace – giving Horde a strong position. In
mechanical terms, Horde PCs might earn renown among their people (perhaps an Aspect “Defender• 
14
• 
17

of Silvermoon” which gives social clout in Horde courts). They could also salvage Alliance equipment
left behind – e.g. a cache of gnomish bombs or Alliance siege blueprints, potentially usable in future
battles (like maybe turning them on the Alliance in a counter-invasion of Arathi or Gilneas). The
emotional tone: Horde victory here prolongs the war and emboldens Sylvanas loyalists, but it could
trouble rebels – some like Saurfang might lament the slaughter of Alliance soldiers who were just
trying to stop Sylvanas’s aggression. If PC rebels exist, they may feel guilty benefiting from this win.
Alternatively, a Horde win might come because of a rebel PC’s valor (even if they plan to oppose
Sylvanas later, they still defended their homeland). That complexity can be roleplayed in subsequent
Acts. 
Stalemate / Partial Outcomes: It’s possible neither side fully “wins.” Maybe the Alliance breaks into
Silvermoon but cannot hold it – they evacuate after inflicting heavy damage (a scenario similar to
Theramore: city devastated but not occupied). Or Alliance captures Silvermoon City proper, but the
Sunwell is saved by Horde and remains in their control (perhaps Liadrin’s last act is teleporting the
Sunwell’s heart somewhere safe, denying Alliance the prize). In such a stalemate, both claim victory:
Alliance dealt a huge blow (the city in ruins, many Horde casualties) while Horde kept their sacred
font and ultimately the Alliance withdrew. This scenario might please no one – it could be a catalyst
for third parties to intervene (maybe the Argent Crusade or Kirin Tor urging both to stop before
more disaster). Fate-wise, you’d narrate that as both Morale tracks hitting zero around the same
time, causing mutual exhaustion. The aftermath might see a temporary armistice around
Silvermoon’s ruins as both sides lick wounds, which cunning PCs could leverage to push for larger
peace talks (or, conversely, Sylvanas might plan a nasty counter-strike while the Alliance is reeling). If,
say, the Alliance corrupted the Sunwell but didn’t secure it, the Blood Elves will be desperate – they
might reach out to anyone for help, even the Alliance or Argent Crusade, to purify it. That could open
diplomatic doors unexpectedly (imagine Alleria, guilt-ridden, offering to help restore what she
tainted – an incredible character moment). Partial outcomes allow creative follow-ups: perhaps
Aethas Sunreaver (a neutral-ish Blood Elf in Dalaran) brokers a deal wherein Alliance withdraws in
exchange for some concession (maybe the Sunreavers rejoin the Kirin Tor, etc.). GMs can tailor this to
how they want the war to progress. 
In summary, the Siege of Silvermoon warfront is a high-stakes, multifaceted battle. It incorporates
“scrapped” Blizzard ideas – an Alliance push on Silvermoon with a likely Horde-favored outcome – but
gives PCs agency to flip the script if they perform exceptionally. It also plays with lore what-ifs: What if the
Void was unleashed at the Sunwell? What if Blood Elves considered surrender to the Alliance? What if Alleria
confronted her past on the battlefield? By running this warfront, GMs provide an epic climax of Act II or a
dramatic turning point in Act III. The outcome will surely influence the later Acts, especially the stance of the
Blood Elves in the final rebellion against Sylvanas (if the Alliance won, the Blood Elves might even quit the
Horde early; if the Horde won, the Blood Elves remain but possibly at heavy cost which could sway
Lor’themar’s decisions). Use the rich cast and the Fate mechanics (aspects for battlefield conditions and
morale) to create a memorable wartime narrative where player decisions—strategic and moral—determine
the fate of an entire kingdom. 
Warfront: Assault on the Exodar
Context & Setup: In a bold counter-move, the Horde opens a second front in Kalimdor by assaulting the
Exodar, the draenei capital on Azuremyst Isle. This scenario was not in the original content, but it mirrors
the idea of warfronts on Kalimdor (the datamined “Southern Barrens Warfront” hinted at Horde offensives• 
11
18

). Here, the Horde, fresh from occupying Darnassus’s ruins and Darkshore, seeks to eliminate the last
major Alliance stronghold on north Kalimdor. Strategically, this would solidify Horde control over Kalimdor
by removing the Draenei (whose Exodar could serve as a beachhead for Alliance counter-invasions). The
assault is launched from Darkshore, using the port of Lor’danel as a staging ground for ships to reach
Azuremyst. The Horde strike force is led by a mix of Sylvanas’s loyalists and Kalimdor-based commanders:
High Warlord Gorchuk (an orc veteran sent by Sylvanas), Deathstalker Commander Belmont (leading
Forsaken units after victories in Darkshore), and notably, two Night Elf turncoats: Dark Ranger Alaina (one
of the risen Darkshore sentinels now loyal to Sylvanas) and Sira Moonwarden (the former Night Elf warden
raised into undeath, burning with hatred for Tyrande). This gives the Horde intimate knowledge of the
terrain (those night elves know the route to Azuremyst well) and a cruel psychological edge (Nightborne
magi from Suramar might also lend support as they hold grudges against the Draenei for past conflicts). On
the Alliance side, the defense is spearheaded by the Draenei leadership and their allies: Prophet Velen
himself stands to defend his people, High Exarch Turalyon (Alleria’s husband, leading the Army of the
Light, possibly present if the Exodar is under dire threat), Captain Fareeya (leader of the Lightforged
draenei) commanding the Army of the Light infantry, and Priestess Ishanah of the Aldor providing support
(drawing on Outland draenei veterans). Additionally, if any Night Elf forces survived Teldrassil, they have
likely evacuated to Azuremyst – thus Mia Greymane (Genn’s wife, who took refugees) and Malfurion
Stormrage (if healed from War of Thorns injuries by now) may be present, lending the kaldorei’s rage to the
defense. The Exodar itself is not just a city but a dimension-traveling ship infused with Naaru technology – it
has unique defenses and vulnerabilities. The Horde’s goal is to destroy or capture the Exodar (either
outcome removes the Draenei threat). The Alliance’s goal is to repel the invasion and protect the Exodar’s
core (the Vessel of the Naaru ). Stakes are sky-high: victory for Horde here could mean genocide or exile of
the Draenei from Azeroth, while victory for Alliance secures a refuge for all Kalimdor Alliance survivors. 
Battlefield Aspects: Shrouding Sea Fog, Blessed Ground of the Naaru, Crystal Spires & Choke Points. Azuremyst
is often covered in a mystical fog – the Horde approaches under a Shrouding Sea Fog, giving them initial
stealth (Horde can invoke it for ambushes as they land, Alliance might suffer a penalty on early Notice
checks). However, once combat starts, that fog can be dispelled or even turned to the Alliance’s advantage if
a shaman PC calls winds to blow it back into the Horde’s face (concealing sniper perches). Blessed Ground of
the Naaru represents the Exodar’s holy aura – within the Exodar’s vicinity, holy magic is amplified and fel or
shadow is weakened. Alliance healers get a boost (free invoke on healing actions), while Horde warlocks or
shadow priests might find their powers dampened (the GM can compel this aspect against a Forsaken
apothecary trying to spread plague: “the ground itself glows and neutralizes your blight”). This encourages
Horde to try sabotage – maybe sending agents to break the Exodar’s Heart of Light (more on that later).
Finally, Crystal Spires & Choke Points denotes the Exodar’s architecture: narrow hallways, crystalline corridors
that funnel attackers. Alliance can capitalize on this by holding chokepoints (300-style last stand in a narrow
hall), and Horde must find ways to bypass or blast through walls. A clever Horde PC might scale a crystal
spire to flank defenders, or an Alliance PC might collapse a hallway intentionally to block a route (stunt idea:
Draenei Crystal Singing – cause parts of the ship’s structure to shift). This aspect encourages environmental
tactics – not every fight is head-on; it’s about navigating a maze-like interior (if battle gets that far). 
Objectives: The Horde assault unfolds in three phases (objectives), akin to the Silvermoon warfront but
roles reversed:
Landfall on Azuremyst – The Horde must land their forces on Azuremyst Isle’s shore and establish a
beachhead near the Exodar’s landing site. Objectives in this phase: Overcome coastal defenses (the
Draenei have Crystal Turrets along the beach that fire Light beams at incoming ships) and Secure10
1. 
19

the Verdant Fields (an open area between coast and Exodar). The initial conflict could be a race:
Horde rushing to disable turrets and bring more troops ashore, Alliance racing to destroy the
landing boats or hold a line. PCs on Horde side can lead vanguard parties, dealing with hazards like
Restless Draenei Ancestor spirits that roam the isle (perhaps Velen awakened them to defend –
treat them as neutral spectral guardians that attack any intruders; Horde might dispel or avoid them,
Alliance could potentially beseech them for aid). One set-piece: Plaguelord Retharb (a Forsaken
apothecary) attempts to deploy a blight bomb on the beach to cover Horde advance with toxic fog.
Alliance PCs must stop or neutralize this (maybe by sniping Retharb or using a Druid to cleanse the
area with swift growing vines). If the blight bomb goes off, it creates an aspect “Blight Fog”
hampering Alliance (and enraging any Night Elf present – their lands were blighted before, now even
Azuremyst?). Alliance can counter with Azuremyst’s Gift – e.g., summoning the island’s native
olembas (healing herbs) or local furbolgs for help. This landing phase is where Horde’s Darkshore
veterans shine – Dark Ranger Alaina leads a covert unit around Alliance lines to eliminate turret
operators (PC rogues could partake in that). Meanwhile, Alliance’s native defenders like Sha’tar
Vindicators form shield walls on the beach. PCs influence outcomes: if Horde PCs succeed in taking
out turrets quickly, the bulk of Horde forces lands safely (morale boost for Horde). If Alliance PCs
manage to sink or set ablaze some Horde ships (maybe using a gnomish “giga-cannon” installed on
Exodar’s outer hull by Gelbin Mekkatorque for this emergency), the Horde invasion might be delayed
or thinned (Horde morale –1, as many drown). 
Breach the Exodar’s Outer Defenses – Now the fight moves to the Exodar’s immediate perimeter
and entrances. The Exodar has an energy barrier (courtesy of the Naaru) sealing its main gate.
Horde must shatter this shield and storm inside. Objectives: Destroy the Exodar Crystal Gates and
Secure the Crystal Hall (the wide initial chamber). Key events: The Horde brings siege equipment
from Darkshore – e.g., Goblin Demolishers or a captured Glaive Thrower from the Night Elves. They
use these to pound the shield. Alliance PCs can sortie out to destroy these engines (perhaps riding
elekks in a cavalry charge against the siege weapons). If an Alliance PC mage or engineer is skilled,
they might even invert the barrier to allow Alliance out but not Horde in – a risky play (succeeding
could let Alliance do a surprise counter-attack out the gate). Meanwhile, other entry points exist:
Service tunnels beneath (leading to the Exodar’s engine rooms) – Sira Moonwarden likely tries a
stealth insertion with a squad of Nightborne saboteurs here. Alliance PCs who anticipate this (maybe
a Draenei PC knows of these tunnels and sets ambushes or traps) can thwart an entire prong of the
invasion. If they fail to guard it, Horde saboteurs might blow up an engine inside, causing power
outages (creating an aspect “Flickering Lights” – darkness inside that benefits Horde darkvision).
The Crystal Hall defense is dramatic: Velen himself stands at the gate, casting blessings on
defenders. Horde PCs might face Velen in a non-direct way (like enduring his mass prayer that saps
their will – a mental attack representing the Naaru’s hymn of holy light filling attackers with
remorse). Perhaps a Tauren PC or Mag’har with strong will can rally the Horde to push through
(contest of Will vs. Velen’s potent empathy). Pivotal NPC confrontation here: Turalyon vs. Nathanos
Blightcaller (if present) or vs. High Warlord (if Nathanos is elsewhere). We didn’t list Nathanos
among initial leaders since by lore he was in Zandalar around this time, but a GM could include him
if desired, leading the assault personally with Sylvanas’s blessing. Turalyon, as a legendary paladin,
would seek him out on the battlefield. PCs could influence this duel – maybe an Alliance PC aids
Turalyon, tipping it so Nathanos is badly wounded and forced to retreat (removing a major threat in
final phase), or a Horde PC covers Nathanos with sniper fire, forcing Turalyon back. If Turalyon were
to fall here (possible if PC actions fail to protect him and GM wants high stakes), Alliance morale
would plummet (-2 perhaps, losing a living legend). If Nathanos falls, Horde morale –2 similarly (their2. 
20

field general gone). Exodar Interior Aspects: once inside, the fight is under pulsating crystal lights
with narrow passes – Crystal Spires & Choke Points from earlier fully applies. Alliance will try funneling
Horde into killzones where a triage of vindicators and Light-forged golems await. Horde might
spread out to alternate corridors (a PC scout could find an unguarded maintenance shaft to flank).
One interesting feature: The Exodar Teleportation Nodes – glowing pads that normally transport
people around the ship. In war, Draenei might repurpose them to teleport strike teams behind
Horde lines (perhaps an Alliance PC arcane engineer jumps onto a pad to blink behind the Horde
vanguard with reinforcements). Horde rogues might hack a pad to bring in reinforcements from
their ships straight into the Exodar (e.g., “We attuned this pad to our mage’s signal – now additional
Felguards port in”). This can be a contest of control over Exodar’s systems (maybe a series of
Overcome rolls from each side’s tech specialist). 
Defend/Destroy the Heart of the Exodar (Finale) – The climax occurs in the Exodar’s core: the Seat
of the Naaru, where the heart of the ship (a Naaru named O’ros, or its powered crystal after O’ros
was hurt in BC) resides. The Horde’s final objective is to either kill the resident Naaru / destroy the
heart (which would cripple the Exodar permanently and possibly cause a massive explosion) or seize
control of it (if Sylvanas plans to use the Exodar as a weapon or bargaining chip). The Alliance of
course aims to prevent this, even at great cost. Pivotal NPCs at finale: Prophet Velen and any
surviving leaders (Malfurion, etc.) rally here for last stand. Horde’s leaders (the high warlord, dark
rangers) push here. Possibly Sylvanas, upon hearing the battle is at the critical point, could send in a
reinforcement via portal: e.g., Blood Prince Thal’len (a San’layn vampire she had in service) appears
to tip scales, or Gallywix shows up in his mech to claim the Exodar tech. GMs can play with a
surprise villain entry if needed. Major mechanics in final battle: Naaru’s Plea – the wounded Naaru
(or heart) periodically pulses a wave of Light energy that affects everyone. It might heal Allies and
burn Horde undead. But also, in its damaged state, it could surge unpredictably. Perhaps it
alternates: one round it blesses Alliance, next round it, in pain, lashes out at all in a radius with
searing light (both sides scramble for cover). PCs could attempt to communicate or stabilize the
Naaru. For instance, a PC priest might use their turn to calm the Naaru’s song (reduce the hazardous
pulses). If they succeed dramatically, the Naaru might even directly aid – e.g., fully resurrect a fallen
important NPC on Alliance side or disintegrate a demon on Horde side. Conversely, Horde warlocks
or shadow priests may try to corrupt or silence the Naaru – if they succeed (ritual or artifact use),
they could turn its power off or twist it (imagine a Dark Naaru scenario – it flips to a void state like
M’uru did, which could ironically help Horde void users but also potentially harm everyone with
shadow damage pulses). Such shifts would drastically change the tone: e.g., if the Naaru goes void,
All Alliance defenders relying on Light are shaken (morale hit and mechanical hinder), while undead
Horde might cackle as their power grows. But also a void Naaru could start reanimating the
Draenei’s own holy golems as void monsters against them (a risk no one wants!). Key choice: Save
or Sacrifice the Exodar? Alliance PCs may face a terrible decision if defeat looms: Prophet Velen
might propose overloading the Exodar’s engine as a last resort – basically turning the ship into a
holy bomb to take out the Horde. “If we cannot save the Exodar, we shall make it its own weapon,” he
intones. This would involve evacuating as many civilians as possible through emergency portals
(perhaps Genn Greymane and Mia help with that, ferrying refugees to Stormwind), while a few
heroes stay behind to ensure the overload happens. If PCs go with this plan (perhaps as a literally
last stand scenario), you can have an emotional ending where the Exodar explodes in radiant light,
vaporizing the remaining Horde attackers – and the heroes inside presumably… though maybe at
the very last second a portal whisked them or at least Velen away (GM choice if PCs survive via Fate
point handwave or heroic sacrifice). This is a pyrrhic Alliance victory (Horde invasion stopped, but the3. 
21

Draenei lose their home again). It draws on themes of Draenei’s sacrifice and possibly was
something fans speculated – the Draenei are used to losing their ships, sadly. If PCs prevent that (like
“No, we can still win conventionally!” or if Horde is clearly going to win fast, then Alliance can’t even
do that), other outcomes follow. Victory/Defeat Branches:
Now summarizing outcomes:
Horde Victory – The Exodar Falls: If the Horde completes objectives (Exodar’s core destroyed or all
defenders neutralized), it’s a massive Horde win. Narratively, the Exodar is in flames. Possibly the
entire ship city crashes (if the battle damaged its anti-grav engines). Draenei survivors would flee or
be captured. Prophet Velen might foresee defeat and escape via a portal to Stormwind with as many
as he can (maybe even leaving a sorrowful prophetic line, “This darkness I cannot stop… Light
protect us in what’s to come”). Horde planting their flag on the smoking Exodar echoes the siege of
Lordaeron vibes in reverse – a major Alliance capital eliminated. Sylvanas would be pleased, but also
keen to exploit Exodar tech. Perhaps she orders the wreckage scavenged; Goblin crews find power
crystals or even the skeletal remains of the naaru – these become weird loot (e.g., a Fragment of
Naaru that Horde shamans/warlocks might use in bizarre experiments, granting maybe a one-time
supercharge to spells at cost of self-harm). Morale-wise, Horde across the globe cheer – Alliance has
basically no foothold on northern Kalimdor now. However, such a victory might actually sow seeds of
Horde dissent, ironically – consider Baine or Saurfang’s perspective: the Horde just wiped out the
peaceful Draenei capital, an act as heinous as Teldrassil. This could galvanize those who think
Sylvanas has gone too far. If PCs are rebel-leaning, they might find this victory hollow or troubling
(“We have become the monsters the Alliance believed us to be”). Nonetheless, in immediate war
terms, Horde victory at Exodar is a critical blow to Alliance. Alliance PCs in this scenario likely retreat
shattered; maybe they ensure at least Velen or some key civilians escape, so it’s not total loss of life.
This defeat might motivate Alliance leaders like Anduin to get even more desperate or aggressive
(e.g., trigger the decision to strike Zandalar with all they have – maybe that becomes more ruthless).
As for players, a Horde win might yield tangible rewards: “Spoils of the Exodar” – e.g., a cache of
Draenei Phase Crystals (could be used to craft a teleport device or phase armor). A PC might salvage a
Lightforged Draenei armor from a fallen champion, using it as a potent Aspect (“Wearing the Light
of the Fallen”). Politically, if Exodar falls and Silvermoon held in prior warfront, Sylvanas effectively
controls Kalimdor fully and held Eastern Kingdoms minus maybe Stormwind environs – the war tilts
heavily Horde. 
Alliance Victory – Exodar Defended: If the Alliance repels the Horde (perhaps Horde fails to break
in, or is pushed out in final phase by a heroic rally), then the Exodar stands. This is akin to the
Alliance “counter-victory” to Teldrassil – they’ve denied Sylvanas her prize. It shows the Horde can be
stopped. Velen might declare it a victory of the Light’s grace. Practically, Alliance keeps a sanctuary in
Kalimdor for refugees (this could be where Tyrande, if alive, later does her Night Warrior ritual
anyway, etc.). If Alliance wins decisively, maybe a major Horde character is captured: e.g., Sira
Moonwarden could be knocked unconscious and taken prisoner by Tyrande’s watchers (imagine
Tyrande’s grim satisfaction to recapture the traitor warden – could be a personal side plot). Or if
Nathanos was there and Alliance wins, he might retreat in rage, or if captured that’d be huge
(though likely he flees). Alliance victory likely requires that the Exodar remains intact (or only lightly
damaged). Perhaps the players managed to stabilize the Naaru and even use it to blast the Horde
fleet at sea, forcing a rout. A special heroic moment: Maybe Malfurion (if present) unleashes a
massive hurricane that wrecks the Horde’s anchored ships once Alliance on ground start winning –• 
• 
22

cutting off Horde retreat or supply. Horde then either must surrender or die. Many likely choose
retreat via whatever portals they have left. Aftermath: Sylvanas is furious at her failure. She might
punish those responsible (if a Horde PC commander survived, they could face her wrath in a tense
roleplay scene – maybe she executes the high warlord for incompetence). This failure might
embolden Alliance to take more aggressive steps in other theaters (perhaps Anduin sends more aid
to Jaina in Kul Tiras quickly since Exodar is safe). It also is a morale boost: the first major Horde
attack that failed. PC rewards: The Draenei are generous – they might gift a Shard of Holy Light (an
item from the Exodar core that can be invoked to smite undead or bless an area). Or a PC might be
granted the title “Anchorite of the Exodar” if they did something akin to saving the naaru –
essentially marking them as a champion of the Draenei people (invokable for respect among Draenei
and Light-aligned folk). Politically, an Alliance win here keeps the war more evenly matched and
preserves Alliance hope. Horde might start doubting Sylvanas’s “invincibility.” If any Horde PCs were
among the attackers and survive to flee, they’ll carry harrowing tales of the Light’s force. Perhaps a
Horde PC even starts questioning the war if they saw something awe-inspiring (like Velen sparing
some injured Horde out of mercy at the end, shaming them). 
Mutual Destruction / Pyrrhic scenarios: There’s room for outcomes like the Exodar being
destroyed but the Horde force also being annihilated – essentially a draw but strategic Alliance loss
(no capital, but Horde lost so many troops it’s a hollow win). This could occur if players triggered the
self-destruct or if the Naaru core went unstable and blew up during the climax. In such a scenario,
everyone is counting bodies. Sylvanas “succeeds” in removing Exodar, but at enormous cost (perhaps
her elite Darkshore veterans are mostly dead, etc.). The Alliance loses the Exodar but perhaps
manages to evacuate most civilians. This might actually unite Alliance and Horde rebels more, as
both are horrified by the carnage. Velen might survive and take his people’s second exile with
sorrowful dignity, potentially swaying neutral factions to Alliance aid (“the Draenei once again have
lost their home – will no one help these noble people?” could be a rallying cry at the Argent Crusade
or something). The Horde might lose key figures in the blast (imagine if a GM wanted to kill off, say,
Gallywix in the explosion as a dramatic shuffle – unlikely but possible). If both sides suffer, the war
might pause temporarily out of sheer exhaustion. This could create a narrative beat where Sylvanas
doubles down (“No surrender, even without the Exodar, we will push forward”) while Saurfang/Baine
use the tragedy to convince more Horde that Sylvanas’s path leads to oblivion (increasing rebel
sympathy). 
In implementing the Assault on the Exodar warfront, the GM should focus on the theme of “aggressors
vs. desperate defenders”. It’s a darker mirror of Silvermoon’s scenario. There’s also the spiritual aspect –
the presence of the naaru and Exodar technology introduces a different flavor than the gritty siege of a city.
Fate-wise, emphasize creative use of environment (teleporters, narrow halls) and the contrast of Light vs.
plague or void. Players have big opportunities for heroics: e.g., a PC paladin might carry a wounded civilian
through gunfire to safety (a noble task outside the main objectives but earning them fate points or respect),
or a Horde PC might actually prevent an atrocity (maybe a Horde player stops a fellow apothecary from
gassing a nursery, deciding that’s too far, indicating not all Horde are without honor – something an Alliance
PC might notice and later mention in peace talks). Those touches ensure the warfront isn’t just hack-and-
slash but remains in line with the morally complex tone of BFA. 
By integrating these two warfronts (Silvermoon and Exodar), the campaign gains epic battles that sensibly
expand on BFA’s story using known lore (the scrapped warfront concept of Alliance attacking Silvermoon
 and a hypothetical Horde attack on an Alliance capital to mirror Teldrassil). These scenarios challenge• 
21
23

players not just in combat, but in making impactful choices (sparing civilians, risking corruption of holy
sites, prioritizing which objective to take first, etc.). They also provide unique Aspects, Stunts, and rewards
tied deeply to Warcraft lore (e.g., Sunwell energies, Naaru songs) for Fate Core gameplay. Whether used as
set-piece chapters or as alternate history modules, they seamlessly slot into the campaign, giving both
Horde and Alliance players moments of massive triumph or tragedy that will resonate through the
remainder of the story.
Enemy Compendium / GM Bestiary
Overview: This section provides a robust roster of adversaries for the GM to draw upon, covering the
breadth of Battle for Azeroth’s warfare. It includes stat blocks and descriptions for standard troops, elite
units (mini-bosses), and unique boss-level foes that the PCs may encounter during warfronts, sieges, and
other scenarios. Each enemy entry is tailored for Fate Core, with key Aspects, skills/approaches, stunts, and
stress levels, ensuring they are compatible with the Fate Core rules (drawing guidance from the Fate Core
rulebook and Toolkit). The designs also take inspiration from the campaign’s NPC companion profiles
from Parts 1–3, maintaining consistency in power levels and narrative style. Enemies are organized broadly
by faction or theme (Alliance, Horde, or other), and by tier (common soldier, elite, boss). GMs can mix and
match these foes in combat scenes or challenges, invoking their Aspects to enhance the drama. We
preserve citations where applicable to show lore basis (e.g., wowpedia entries confirming unit roles). Let’s
equip you with the foes your players will face:
Standard Soldiers & Mooks
These are the rank-and-file – not individually powerful, but dangerous in numbers. They often come in
mobs using the Fate mob rules (single shared stress track, acting as one with bonuses for size). Their
Aspects capture their training and cultural flavor.
Kul Tiran Marine (Alliance Infantry) – Aspect: “Brine-Hardened Marine of Kul Tiras”, “Disciplined
Boarding Party Veteran”. Kul Tiran marines are burly, sea-seasoned humans, drilled to fight on ship
decks and storm beaches. Skills/Approaches: Good (+3) Fight, Fair (+2) Athletics, Fair (+2) Shoot
(they carry flintlock rifles for ranged volleys), Average (+1) Will. Stunts: Boarding Axe Swing – When
fighting in close quarters (ship decks, narrow spaces), a Kul Tiran Marine gains +2 to Fight (their
strength and balance excels in cramped brawls). Volley Fire – As an action, a group of marines can
coordinate musket fire: treat as creating aspect “Pinned by Musket Volley” on their target (with a
free invoke) – this represents suppressing fire that PCs must overcome to move or act freely. Stress: 2
(an individual marine), or for a mob of 3-5 marines, give a 3-point stress track. Notes: These marines
are tough (often sporting tattoos and leathers), but not fanatical – if broken by fear or losing their
officer, they might retreat (invoke or compel their discipline aspect accordingly). They often serve
aboard Alliance ships or coastal fortifications, making them likely foes in naval scenarios or port
battles. GMs can portray their camaraderie and navy jargon (“Fire a warning shot! Show these bilge
rats Kul Tiran steel!”). Despite being “mooks,” their strong Fight skill means they can threaten less
armored PCs in melee. However, they lack magic or fancy tricks – straightforward, reliable soldiers.
Forsaken Blightguard (Horde Infantry) – Aspect: “Undead Blightguard Trooper”, “Plague Zealot in
Service of the Banshee Queen”. The Forsaken Blightguards are specialized footmen of Sylvanas’s
army, equipped to deploy blight in battle. They wear modified leather armor with gas masks and
often ride skeletal horses in open field engagements. Skills/Approaches: Fair (+2) Shoot (they carry•

•

blight grenades and crossbows), Fair (+2) Stealth (years of ambush tactics), Average (+1) Fight,
Average (+1) Craft (for handling blight concoctions). Stunts: Blight Grenadier – Once per scene, a
Blightguard can throw a blight bomb: create aspect “Spreading Blight Cloud” on the zone. This
imposes an obstacle (PCs must overcome a Fair (+2) Physique or suffer “Poisoned” aspect). They
themselves are immune to it. Undead Fortitude – +2 to defend with Will against fear or intimidation
(being undead, they don’t startle easily and feel no pain). Stress: 2 (mook). Notes: Blightguards often
operate in units supporting heavier troops. They aren’t heavy melee fighters; their main threat is
area control via poison. They’ll try to soften targets with blight then let others (or the blight itself) do
the work. They exemplify the Forsaken penchant for cruel tactics – a compel on “Plague Zealot”
could have one choose to detonate himself with blight rather than be captured. However, if cornered
without their blight, their morale can falter (they know their unlives are forfeit if caught). Use them
to put pressure on PCs to move – e.g., an invocation of “Spreading Blight Cloud” might force players
out of cover. In lore, some Forsaken Blightguards were seen in Zandalar’s ports and Darkshore’s
warfront, so they fit any Sylvanas-led battlefield.
Zandalari Berserker (Horde Infantry) – Aspect: “Zandalari Warrior Loa-Blessed”, “Savage Pride of
Zandalar”. These trolls fight with two-handed glaives or spears, often going into battle in a trance of
fury. Skills: Good (+3) Athletics (acrobatic leaps, climbing), Fair (+2) Fight, Fair (+2) Physique, Average
(+1) Provoke (battle cries). Stunts: Devastating Leap – A berserker can, once per conflict, jump
impossibly high/far (Loa-enhanced) and slam down on a foe, gaining +2 to a Fight attack on that
exchange. If used against a group, it can be an area attack. Blood Frenzy – If the berserker
inflicts a consequence on an enemy, they immediately gain a free boost “In a Frenzy” which they can
use on their next attack (they get riled up by blood). Stress: 3 (trolls are tough; maybe give a mild
consequence slot as well for a notable berserker). Notes: Zandalari Berserkers often serve in
Warfronts like the Battle for Darkshore or defense of Dazar’alor. Their style is aggressive and
relentless. They might start combat by howling a dedication to a Loa (perhaps invoke their pride
aspect to intimidate foes). They are somewhat reckless; clever PCs can exploit their overcommitment
(e.g., create an Advantage like “Off-Balance from Big Swing” if they dodge an attack dramatically).
Use them to challenge melee-oriented PCs with a strong physical threat. They also scale well – one
berserker is a minor obstacle, but a pair could be a serious fight. Their presence reminds players
that the Horde isn’t just orcs and forsaken; ancient troll warriors are in the fray too, with their own
cultural flair (maybe describe golden tattoos flaring with Loa spirits as they fight).
Night Elf Sentinel (Alliance Archer/Melee) – Aspect: “Kaldorei Sentinel of Darnassus”, “Vengeance
for Teldrassil” (if post-Teldrassil). The Sentinels are the elite all-female guard of the Night Elves,
skilled with bow and glaive. Skills: Good (+3) Shoot (they are deadly archers), Fair (+2) Stealth (meld
into shadows of the forest), Fair (+2) Notice, Average (+1) Fight. Stunts: Shadowmeld – When in a
forest or at night, a Sentinel can become nearly invisible. She gains +2 to Sneakily create an
advantage related to ambush or concealment (drawing from the iconic night elf racial ability).
Double Shot – Once per exchange, if she succeeds with style on a Shoot attack, she may place a
boost “Pinned Down” on a second target (hitting two foes with rapid shots). Stress: 2. Notes: Sentinels
in BFA are often driven by grief/vengeance after Teldrassil. Those emotions can be invoked (or
compelled – e.g., a Sentinel might take unnecessary risks to target a specific Horde unit that torched
Ashenvale). They excel as skirmishers: hit and run, using superior knowledge of terrain. In warfronts
like Darkshore, they form the backbone of Alliance guerrilla tactics. For PC encounters, they might
strike from high vantage points or coordinate with a PC (if allied) to set up crossfire. As foes, a couple
of hidden Sentinels can pepper the party until dealt with (the PCs might need to create an advantage1024

•

25

like “Spotted the Archers’ Perch” to nullify Shadowmeld). They exemplify Alliance’s moral fury – a GM
could have a captured Sentinel spit out, “Tell Sylvanas we will avenge our people,” showing their
resolve (perhaps unsettling a Horde PC). These are competent mooks that can also serve as skilled
NPC allies to bolster an Alliance-side group in a bigger battle.
Elite Units (Mini-Bosses)
These enemies are more powerful or unique, often with special abilities. They typically function alone or
lead squads. Each has at least one consequence slot or higher stress to withstand a bit more from the PCs.
Azerite Juggernaut (Siege Golem – Neutral/Both Factions) – This is a lumbering war machine, a
construct animated by Azerite energy. Think of a fused golem-tank. Aspects: “Runic Azerite
Golem”, “Unstable Power Core”. Skills: Great (+4) Physique (massive strength, resist damage), Good
(+3) Fight (crushing limbs and mounted blades), Fair (+2) Shoot (it might have a shoulder cannon that
fires Azerite blasts), Average (+1) Crafts (simple auto-repair routines). Stunts: Rampage – It can plow
through multiple foes; when charging in a straight line, it attacks all targets in its path with Fight at
+0 (one roll vs multiple targets, as an area attack). Azerite Overload – The juggernaut can push its
core beyond limits: gain +2 on one attack or defense, but afterwards the “Unstable Power Core”
aspect can be compelled by the GM to represent a backlash (e.g., a shockwave or damage to itself).
Basically, a one-time buff with a cost. Thick Plating – Armor counts as an extra mild consequence (2-
point) it can use to absorb harm (narrate as denting armor plates). Stress: 4 and 1 moderate
consequence (plus the armor mild as above). Notes: The Azerite Juggernaut is more of an encounter
than a simple enemy – treat it akin to a vehicle or environmental hazard. PCs might choose to
outsmart it rather than slug it out; e.g., create advantage “Sand in Its Gears” or target its unstable
core directly (maybe an Attack aimed at core triggers a big blow). Lore-wise, both Alliance and Horde
tinkered with Azerite constructs, so it could show up on either side. For example, Gallywix had an
Azerite drilling rig (not quite a golem, but similar vibe). In a warfront, perhaps the Horde deploys this
as a boss; Alliance PCs could lure it into a trap (collapsing a bridge under it). As a foe, it should feel
like a moving battering ram – slow, huge hits, and a potential to explode if things go awry. The
unstable core aspect might be invoked by players to make it misfire (e.g., cause it to take its own
consequence after pushing too far). Defeating it might yield Azerite shards (valuable for the war
effort or as power-ups). Make it memorable with loud grinding noises and glowing blue cracks in its
form as it takes damage.
Warfront Captain (Named Elite Officer – either faction) – This represents those notable enemy
commanders in Warfronts (like Commander Strombane for Alliance or Deathstalker Commander for
Horde). We give a generic template to customize with a name and faction. Aspects: “Battle-
Hardened Warfront Captain”, “Inspirational (or Fearsome) Presence”. Skills: Good (+3) Fight or
Shoot (depending on if they’re melee or ranged specialized), Good (+3) Provoke (to issue commands
or intimidate), Fair (+2) Will, Fair (+2) Athletics (battlefield mobility). Stunts: Rallying Cry – Once per
scene, the Captain can attempt to boost allies: create an advantage “For the (Horde/Alliance)!” that
all their allies can each immediately invoke once for free (essentially a one-turn boost to everyone’s
morale). This is a powerful ability – the PC’s might need to stop the captain before they do this
(perhaps by sniping or dueling them quickly). Tactical Retreat – If the Captain takes a consequence,
they can immediately fall back and become a ranged threat instead of melee (or vice versa).
Mechanically, they clear one zone away without giving full advantage, perhaps using smoke or
bodyguards. This stunt basically lets them prolong engagement, reflecting cunning. Skilled Duelist•

– +2 to Fight or Shoot (whichever primary) when facing a single opponent (they shine in one-on-one,
meaning a PC can’t just solo them easily without risk). Stress/Consequences: 3 stress, 1 mild, 1
moderate consequence. Notes: Use Warfront Captains as mid-bosses in battle scenarios – the fight
might be raging, then this leader appears with some cronies. They likely have a name (“Captain
Alaina Hearthborne”, “Kazgrim Bloodaxe” etc.) and a bit of personality – maybe arrogant or cruel.
Their presence can also be used to justify a short-term buff to enemy mooks (like their Rallying Cry).
In Fate, you might give them the ability to absorb hits on behalf of nearby mooks once or twice,
showing them protecting their troops or being the focus of attacks. PCs might choose to cut the
head off the snake (defeat the Captain) to demoralize the enemy – if a Warfront Captain falls,
consider automatically removing an aspect like “Enemy Morale Boost” or even applying an aspect
“Leaderless Confusion” to remaining foes. They are also ideal for duels with PC leaders: e.g., a PC
general might square off with the enemy captain while armies clash around (others handle the battle
momentum while the two duel). Customize their exact stunts to the faction or individual. For
instance, a Horde captain might have “Blood Fury – +2 to Fight when severely wounded (one per
scene)” whereas an Alliance captain might have “Hold the Line – +2 to defend when protecting an
ally.” The provided stunts are general-purpose, but feel free to tweak to match the narrative of
whichever notable officer the PCs face.
Dark Ranger Executioner (Sylvanas’s elite agents – think of Nathanos’s personal enforcers ) –
These are deadly undead rangers who excel in eliminating high-value targets. Possibly the “personal
executioners” that serve Nathanos or Sylvanas directly. Aspects: “Deadly Dark Ranger”, “Loyal to
the Dark Lady’s Will”. Skills: Good (+3) Shoot, Good (+3) Stealth, Fair (+2) Fight, Fair (+2) Empathy (to
sense weakness/fear), Average (+1) Athletics. Stunts: Called Shot – When a Dark Ranger invokes an
aspect on a target (like if the target is distracted or has “Exposed” aspect), their ranged attack gains
+2 and +2 shifts to damage on a hit (representing an arrow to a vital spot – basically a lethal
precision boost). Umbral Step – They can vanish from one spot and reappear from a shadow
elsewhere (short-range teleport through shadows). Mechanically, once per scene, they may
reposition to any zone stealthily, and the first attack from their new position gains +2 (catching foes
off-guard). Poisoned Arrow – They carry some arrows tipped with a paralytic. On a successful hit,
they may forgo stress to instead place the aspect “Poisoned – Muscles Locking Up” on the target
(with a free invoke). This can take out or debilitate a key PC if not addressed (PC might need
overcome with Physique or get a healer’s aid). Stress: 2 and 1 mild consequence (they are elite but
not supposed to tank hits; they avoid being hit). Notes: Dark Ranger Executioners typically operate in
pairs or trios as Nathanos’s hit squad. They are boss-level threats in terms of damage output but
fragile if cornered. They prefer ambush tactics – striking from high ground or during night. In an
encounter, you might have them systematically target the party’s healer or mage first (using Called
Shot on a vulnerable target). This forces PCs to react quickly to a lethal threat. Their loyalty aspect
can be compelled if, say, Sylvanas gives an order that puts them in harm’s way – they’ll do it without
question (e.g., covering a retreat, sacrificing themselves to allow Nathanos to escape). They could
also be persuaded to stand down only by something that shakes their faith (maybe evidence of
Sylvanas’s betrayal of the Forsaken – but that’s near impossible mid-battle). In lore, dark rangers are
often former high elf sentinels raised into undeath (Sylvanas’s specialty). So one could tie them to a
PC’s backstory if relevant (e.g., a Blood Elf PC might recognize an Executioner as their fallen aunt
turned undead – adding emotional weight). Combat-wise, highlight their eerie silence, unnatural
coordination, and ruthless efficiency (maybe one pins a PC’s foot with an arrow while another aims
for the throat). They should instill a bit of fear – maybe even mechanically, a player might take a
temporary aspect “In Our Sights” if they realize these executioners are focusing them.• 26

Void-Mutated Wretch (Void-corrupted creature – miniboss monster) – The “void-mutated wretch” is
inspired by the idea of mana-addicted elves (Wretched ) or other beings twisted further by void
energies. It could be a Sin’dorei who overdosed on void or a creature from a void tear. Aspects: “Void-
Maddened Wretch”, “Hungers for Magic and Life”. Skills: Fair (+2) Fight, Fair (+2) Athletics, Fair (+2)
Will (its sheer insanity gives resistance to mental influence), Average (+1) Lore (from void whispers –
it sometimes babbles occult secrets). Stunts: Void Lash – The Wretch’s claws are imbued with void. Its
Fight attacks do mental stress in addition to physical (as the void energy assaults the target’s mind
on hit). PCs must consider both stress tracks when facing it. Mana Leech – If the Wretch is near a
spell being cast or an magical aspect in play (like “Arcane Ward” or someone’s active buff), it can
attempt to devour that energy. It rolls Lore vs target’s Will, and on success, the magical effect is
consumed (gone) and the Wretch heals 2 stress or clears a mild consequence. Essentially, it “eats”
magic to restore itself. Umbral Resilience – Once per scene, reduce a physical hit by 2 shifts
(void tendrils soak some harm) – representing its unnatural toughness. Stress/Consequences: 3 stress,
1 mild consequence (or make it 4 stress, as it’s a monster, up to GM). Notes: This enemy is a more
monstrous foe, possibly encountered if Alleria’s void experiments went awry or in areas suffused
with Azerite and void (maybe an Island Expedition scenario or side quest). Wretched in WoW are
usually former elves who lost control to arcane addiction; adding void makes them even more
deranged – perhaps their eyes swirl with violet light and they mutter to the Void Lords. They likely
attack indiscriminately, drawn to whatever source of magic is strongest (so in a fight, they might
prioritize a mage PC or a paladin with a bright aura). This can be compelled to make them
predictable: a clever PC might deliberately create a flashy magical aspect to lure the Wretch, then
spring a trap. They are not tactical, just feral and desperate. However, their void powers make them
tricky – players might initially try normal weapons and find the Wretch shrugs them off with Umbral
Resilience; they might need to use magic or creative methods (like lots of light, since void hates light,
maybe an aspect “Flooded with Light” could weaken the Wretch’s defenses). Upon defeat, it might
collapse into a husk, a pitiable end for what once was perhaps a person. Loot or effect: maybe
shards of void crystal remain that could be hazardous or useful. These creatures underscore the
dangers of uncontrolled magic – a recurring theme speculation and lore often touch (e.g., what if
Alleria created void monstrosities inadvertently ). As a GM, describe the warping effect around
them: nearby torches dim, whispers echo, maybe PCs feel a tug at their own magical reserves when
the Wretch looks their way. That sells the threat beyond its raw stats.
Wicker Horror Beast (Drustvar construct – elite monster) – A hulking construct of wood, bone, and
necromancy crafted by the Heartsbane Coven. These appear as large wickerwork giants
animated by Drust spirits (from Kul Tiras lore). Aspects: “Cursed Wicker Construct”, “Animated by
Drust Death Magic”. Skills: Good (+3) Physique (massive frame), Fair (+2) Fight, Fair (+2)
Intimidation (its horrifying appearance and creaking noises), Average (+1) Armor (passive thick
plating, treated as an advantage like heavy armor plating). Stunts: Treefall Smash – Its long limbs
can hit multiple foes; it can attack two targets in one swing with no penalty (roll once, compare to
each). Horror of the Coven – It exudes fear. Once per encounter, it can force all nearby foes to make
a Will roll (Fair difficulty) or take a “Shaken by Witchcraft” aspect. It doesn’t itself understand tactics,
but this effect is like a frightful presence (some PCs might take a compel to even flee a round if they
fail badly). Reconstitute – Unless its animating spirit is exorcised, the Horror can slowly knit itself
back together. It has an extra stress track for “regeneration” – effectively, after 2 rounds since taking
a physical consequence, it heals that consequence (one per fight). To stop this, PCs might need to
use holy magic or target the sigils on it. Stress/Consequences: 4 stress, 1 mild, 1 moderate
consequence (and the regen ability on one of those as above). Notes: The Wicker Horror is a boss•

likely in a Drustvar side mission or as an added surprise in a warfront in Kul Tiras (maybe the Horde
faces them if the coven goes out of control, or Alliance PCs dealing with leftover Drust magic during
war). They are tough and best handled by exploiting their weaknesses: fire is a natural one (PCs
might light it up, turning its own body into an inferno against it), or use blessed weapons to disrupt
the death magic. Part of the fun is the atmosphere: it crackles with eerie runes, maybe whispers with
the voices of bound Drust spirits. When it falls, the spirit might shriek and dissipate, leaving just inert
twigs. We include it as an enemy type because the question explicitly listed “Wicker Horror Beasts” –
presumably wanting some Fate stats for those iconic Drustvar creatures. They’re a great example of
a neutral faction enemy that could show up (perhaps Alliance and Horde temporarily unite to fight a
Coven ritual raising these things on the battlefield). Mechanically, they’re like golems with a fear
effect and regeneration – straightforward but requiring specific countermeasures (so players could
overcome its regen by, say, a Create Advantage to “Consecrated Ground” so it can’t re-form). This
encourages creative problem-solving beyond whittling hit points (stress).
Usage & Difficulty Tiers:
The above entries can be adjusted to represent different difficulties. For instance, a “Veteran Kul Tiran
Marine Captain” might have +1 on all skills and an extra stunt or consequence compared to a basic marine
(making them more like an elite enemy). Likewise, a swarm of weaker enemies can be a single enemy stat
block with reduced skill but numbers granting team bonuses (for nameless mooks).
When populating an encounter:
- Use Standard Soldiers in groups to challenge PCs with quantity. They might not threaten a high skill PC
one-on-one, but together they invoke teamwork rules (e.g., three marines shooting together for +2 to one
attack roll).
- Elite Units should be the spotlight foes that require focused attention or clever tactics. One Warfront
Captain among a pack of mooks gives the fight structure (mooks occupy the players while the Captain buffs
them or duels a particular PC).
- Boss Foes (Unique) like the Juggernaut or Wicker Horror can serve as the climax of a session’s combat,
often after or amidst dealing with lesser enemies. They have more durability and perhaps require solving a
puzzle (kill the Wicker Horror’s animator, overload the Juggernaut’s core, etc.). 
Each enemy’s Aspects are there for the GM to invoke to make fights dynamic: e.g., invoke “Loyal to the
Dark Lady” on a Dark Ranger to boost an attack at a dramatic moment (they fight with fanatical zeal), or
compel “Unstable Power Core” on the Juggernaut to have it explode earlier than planned (perhaps hurting
both sides). Players too can use these aspects when discovered (a PC might roll Lore or Notice to glean an
aspect like a Juggernaut’s core or a Berserker’s Loa blessing, then use it to their advantage).
Lastly, these adversaries tie into major characters and prior parts: the Dark Rangers serve Nathanos,
the Wicker Horrors tie to Drust sorceress Gorak Tul’s story, etc. GMs can reference NPC companion stats if
needed: e.g., if Jaina is fighting alongside the PCs against a Juggernaut, her Part 1 stat profile shows she has
Aspect “Brilliant Tactician” – she might advise targeting the core, giving PCs a free invoke on that aspect.
This cross-reference encourages integrating these enemies with story and character, not just as stat blocks.
By using this bestiary, the GM can craft encounters that feel authentic to BFA’s setting (Forsaken blight
squads, Alliance marines holding a fort, crazed void mutants in a side quest) while leveraging Fate Core’s
narrative combat. The enemies have enough detail to be flavorful and enough mechanical hooks to26

29

challenge players and be overcome in creative ways. Adjust on the fly as needed (e.g., if PCs are
steamrolling, have a Warfront Captain arrive as reinforcement; if they’re struggling, maybe that
Juggernaut’s unstable core goes off a bit early to their benefit). This roster should cover most combat needs
through the campaign’s dramatic battles, ensuring Part 3’s gameplay remains engaging and true to
Warcraft’s epic and emotive combat scenarios.
