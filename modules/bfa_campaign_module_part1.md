World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth – Fate Core
Campaign Module
Azeroth is ablaze. In the wake of the Legion’s retreat, a new war rages – the Alliance and Horde vie for
supremacy over the very world’s fate. Players take the role of faction champions caught in the Fourth War
(the Battle for Azeroth), where trust is shattered, hope flickers, and every victory carries the weight of loss.
The tone is epic and bleak, but still punctuated by personal bonds, fleeting hope, and even romance amid
turmoil. The campaign weaves themes of war and camaraderie, fractured trust between Alliance and
Horde, moral ambiguity in wartime decisions, and the price of hate and sacrifice. Faction leaders clash
over Azerite’s use – King Anduin seeks it to heal Azeroth, while Warchief Sylvanas treats it as a weapon –
igniting the war after the burning of Teldrassil. The Alliance’s siege of Lordaeron answered Horde
aggression, dragging both peoples into a brutal conflict. Players must navigate this crucible, making
fateful choices with far-reaching consequences.
This module is designed for the Fate Core system. It emphasizes cinematic, narrative-driven play: players
describe heroic actions in vivid detail, and the GM awards Fate Points or invokes Aspects to heighten drama. Prepare to switch between fast-paced battle scenes, tense diplomatic encounters, and quiet
interludes of reflection. Use Fate’s mechanics – Aspects, Fate Points, Skills/Approaches, and
Consequences – as the engine for this war saga. Consequences should cut deep: a demon’s curse might
impose a Mild Mental Consequence (“Visions of Corruption”) that later surfaces as fear in battle.
Rewards for heroism should be generous: extraordinary deeds may earn extra Fate Points or temporary
boons. Remember, nothing is guaranteed – even veteran heroes can fall or falter, and every choice can
reshape the war’s outcome.
Key Themes and Approach
War and Loss: Battles have high stakes. PCs face death of friends and the destruction of homelands.
When players make a heroic sacrifice, reward it with narrative rewards (Fate Points, new Aspects, etc.)
and let it matter.
Faction Conflict and Betrayal: The Horde and Alliance mistrust each other. NPCs like Tyrande and
Sylvanas must confront personal grudges (e.g. Sylvanas’s trail of betrayals, Tyrande’s hatred for
Sylvanas after Teldrassil). This fuels tension and possible cross-faction confrontations.
Fleeting Hope and Comradeship: Even amid chaos, bonds form. Allies in the same faction (or rare
cross-faction allies like Magni or Khadgar) become sounding boards and motivators. The GM can
grant Boost aspects (“Inspired by <Ally’s Name>”) when bonds give advantage.
Moral Ambiguity: Not all choices are clearly good or evil. Sylvanas’s methods are ruthless yet she
believes she protects her people. Anduin seeks peace but must embrace the wrath of war. PCs
should face dilemmas (“Do we spare a defeated foe?”, “How many civilians can we save?”) with
lasting consequences.
Romance in Wartime: Personal relationships (romantic or deep friendships) can blossom or strain
under war. Scenes of quiet in a besieged keep or a campfire after battle can be Interlude scenes1

where characters bond or confess. (For example, allow a scene where two PCs share a moment on a
warship crossing the Sea of Thalassas, representing fleeting solace.)
Fate System Integration
Leverage Fate’s narrative tools throughout:
Aspects: Always define strong Aspects for factions and scenes. For example, a war scene might have
a Situation Aspect like “Burning Light’s Hope” or “Hordes on the Move” that players can invoke or the
GM can compel. Use Aspects on NPCs to reflect their goals/personality – e.g. Sylvanas could have
aspects like “Warchief of the Forsaken” and “Heart of Ice and Ash”. PCs’ own Aspects (from character
creation or origin) can tie into major NPCs: a PC might bear “Student of Magni’s Courage”, invoking
Magni when speaking to him.
NPC Stat Blocks: Draw from Legion ’s advice: don’t overbuild NPCs. Give each major NPC a short
profile of Motivations, Hopes, Fears and a few key Aspects or Stunts, not a full skill pyramid.
As one guide notes, “NPCs in Fate don’t all need full stat blocks; just give them a couple of Aspects
and maybe one stunt or unique ability”. (See Major NPCs section below for examples.)
Stunts/Extras: Represent special powers and Azerite gear as Fate Extras. Fate Core treats any
significant gear or power as an “extra” with its own aspects/stunts. For example, a rare Azerite
weapon can be an extra: it might grant +2 to an attack and an Aspect like “Crackling with Azerite
Magic”. Adjust power with Fate Points (push rolls, invoke the weapon’s aspect, etc.). Require story
justification (e.g. questing to unlock the weapon’s potential).
Scenes: Use three scene types: Action Scenes (battles, sieges, contests), Dramatic Scenes
(negotiation, personal confrontations), and Interludes (campfire talks, flashbacks). For example:
Action: PCs lead a charge on an enemy stronghold (Conflict contest with Zones, summons, etc.). 
Dramatic: PCs debate strategy with faction leaders or interrogate prisoners. 
Interlude: Characters tend wounds in a village, or share memories of home (great for introducing 
romance or grief aspects).
Cinematic Play: Encourage players to narrate heroically. Allow “succeed with cost” instead of boring
failure. One example from Legion: if a hero tries a daring stunt and fails, narrate a partial win plus
consequence (the PC might break a shield, sprain an arm, etc.). Emulate wow cinematic
moments (e.g. a Warlock surfing a fel eruption or a Warrior leaping onto a flying machine).
Fate Point Economy & Rewards: Follow Legion advice to reward great roleplay and heroism with
extra Fate Points or story boons. After a pivotal achievement or inspiring speech, consider
handing out an immediate Fate Point or adding a beneficial Aspect (“Inspired by <PC>” etc.).
Conversely, compelling dark doubts (fear of failing allied villages, guilt from casualties) can drain
Fate Points or force Compels. This interplay drives drama.
Major NPCs and Factions
Key BFA leaders drive the conflict. For each major NPC, we provide a brief psychological profile
(motivation, hopes, fears, personality traits) and a Fate-like stat summary. These are guides for roleplay:
use their Aspects to compel or invoke, and their Stunts/Abilities once or twice per session to create drama.
(Allies can usually be aided for free, and the GM can simply set their skills on the fly during scenes. The•

Legion module cautions that “primary lore figures might be Epic-level opponents or peers… but you
rarely need to roll for allies”.)
Sylvanas Windrunner, Warchief of the Horde
Profile: Sylvanas is ruthless and determined. Motivation: Secure the Horde’s survival and power at
any cost. Hope: Forge a future free of weakness for her people. Fear: Betrayal from within and losing
her hard-won victories. She has come to see mercy as weakness, and the lives of the defeated as
expendable. 
Aspects: “Warchief of the Forsaken and Horde”, “Crown of Ash and Thorns”, “Heart Cold as Ice”. (These
reflect her authority, her willingness to sacrifice, and her emotional detachment.) 
Stunts/Powers: Warchief’s Command: Once per scene, Sylvanas can flashily create a Horde Assault
advantage (e.g., rally troops or demoralize enemies) that allies can use with a free invoke. Banshee’s
Wail: Once per session, she may inflict a Strong Mental Consequence on an opponent as if casting a
spell (e.g. “Haunted by Defeat”). 
Roleplay Tips: Stoic and intimidating. She rarely shows doubt publicly, but privately she worries
about unruly Horde pride and looming threats. In scenes, you might emphasize her tactical coldness
(“We will burn their cities as they burned ours”) or her distrust of fellow leaders. Even if the PCs are
Horde, Sylvanas may question their allegiance if they hesitate. (She does not die except in an epic
climactic showdown; players might attempt to end her, but Fate might have her escape or be
defeated by another force, unless it is the final epilogue confrontation.)
King Anduin Wrynn, Leader of the Alliance
Profile: Anduin is young, compassionate, and burdened by kingship. Motivation: End the war
honorably and protect the innocent. Hope: Unite people through faith and diplomacy. Fear:
Becoming like his rageful father or committing atrocities. He values mercy but knows he must grow
tougher. 
Aspects: “Young King of Stormwind”, “Heart of Gold”, “Faith of the Light”. (He can lean on these for
healing or inspiring others.) 
Stunts/Powers: Inspirational Prayer: Once per scene, if Anduin is present, he can flashily create an
Aspect “Inspired by the King’s Resolve” (free invoke) bolstering allies (+2 to a key roll). Light’s Embrace:
He can attempt to remove a Mild or Moderate Consequence from an ally (aided by Lore or Will). 
Roleplay Tips: Gentle but determined. He should speak sincerely about hope, but his Line (values)
can crack under pressure (“I will never harm innocents!” can be compelled if PCs must fight savage
foes). In Act II, a warm memory of his father Varian might inspire or haunt him. When war drags on,
let him struggle with anger and doubt. As a relatively minor combatant, he typically stays behind the
lines, but he may join one key battle at the players’ bidding. (Allies who know Anduin could invoke
“We fight for Anduin’s Dream” when standing by his side.)
Lor’themar Theron, Regent Lord of Quel’Thalas (Horde)
Profile: Proud Blood Elf leader. Motivation: Rebuild Quel’Thalas and secure Horde’s victory. Hope:
Restore Silvermoon’s former glory. Fear: Losing his people again or failing Sylvanas. He is dutiful but
internally torn by Sylvanas’s extremism. 
Aspects: “Regent Lord of Quel’Thalas”, “Burning Passion for my People”, “Torn Loyalty to the Horde”. 11

Stunts: Sunfury Discipline: Once per scene, Lor’themar can counter an opponent’s advantage by
spending a Fate Point (narratively, he channels the Sun King’s resolve). Arcane Swiftness: Gains +2 to
any Resist action involving ranged or arcane attacks. 
Roleplay Tips: Stiff and formal, but actually kind-hearted. He may plead with Sylvanas privately or
resent her tactics. If PCs help him justify against other Horde leaders, he will be warmly supportive.
If they dishonor his people, he may become stiffly hostile.
Varok Saurfang, Veteran Chieftain of the Warsong (Horde)
Profile: Honor-bound orc warrior. Motivation: Fight a noble war and end Sylvanas’s tyranny. Hope: Die
fighting an honorable cause. Fear: The Horde’s soul dying under Sylvanas, and his former mate Baine
being endangered. He is weary but courageous. 
Aspects: “Veteran Chieftain of the Warsong”, “True to the Horde’s Honor”, “Bearing the Weight of Defeat”. 
Stunts: Challenge of Honor: Once per scene, Saurfang can force a 1-on-1 duel (a Create Advantage
“Honorable Duel”) with a named enemy (taking +2 on his first attack in that duel). Second Wind: If he
takes a Consequence, he may immediately clear it after his next turn (GM may narrate him
summoning inner strength). 
Roleplay Tips: Gruff but fair. He’ll admonish reckless Horde tactics (compelling “Rash Horde Tactics”
Aspect on conflict), and inspire Alliance (if present) to show mercy. He is destined for a climactic
duel (the Mak’gora against Sylvanas) – in canon he perishes, but the PCs could intervene (raising the
stakes). Use him as the conscience of the Horde: he reluctantly follows Sylvanas but at a breaking
point.
Baine Bloodhoof, High Chieftain of Thunder Bluff (Horde)
Profile: Gentle Tauren leader. Motivation: Protect his people and honor the Horde’s alliance. Hope:
Achieve peace through strength. Fear: Sylvanas’s recklessness and potential war crimes. Baine is
noble but conflicted by his loyalty. 
Aspects: “High Chieftain of Thunder Bluff”, “Gentle Giant with a Fierce Heart”, “Bound by Honor”. 
Stunts: Earth’s Blessing: Once per scene, Baine can heal one ally’s minor Consequence (like using a 5-
minute heal) if he prays to the Earth Mother. War Cry: Flashily create an aspect “Roused by Bloodlust”
that gives all Horde allies +2 to their next roll against demoralized foes. 
Roleplay Tips: Soft-spoken, empathetic. He may try to mediate between Sylvanas and Saurfang or
prevent needless slaughter. If players ally with him, he could open up (hope for reconciliation); if they
provoke him, he shows calm but firm resolve (“You fight me, you fight the Bulls”). Baine can be a key
NPC at Dazar’alor or Orgrimmar to influence Horde morale.
Nathanos Blightcaller, Champion of the Banshee Queen (Horde)
Profile: Sylvanas’s right hand, an undead ranger. Motivation: Enact Sylvanas’s will and prove himself. 
Hope: Earn Sylvanas’s approval. Fear: Serving a cause bigger than his love for her. He is passionate
and vengeful, ruthless in battle. 
Aspects: “Banshee Blood Lord of the Forsaken”, “Bound by Love and Duty”, “Dark Vengeance Incarnate”. 
Stunts: Dark Champion: Once per scene, Nathanos may Flashily create the Aspect “Fury of the
Blightcaller” on an enemy he marks, giving him +2 to his next attack against that foe. Soul Wound: He
ignores the normal +2 defense against surprise attacks (reflecting his undead senses). •

Roleplay Tips: Intense and single-minded. He never speaks ill of Sylvanas, but if a PC tries to kill her,
Nathanos will become fanatically protective (compel him to intervene). If PCs show themself worthy,
he could offer raw information (with price). He is loyal to Sylvanas above all, and sees personal
relationships as weakness.
Jaina Proudmoore, Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras (Alliance)
Profile: Powerful mage and wartime leader. Motivation: Defeat the Horde to avenge her people and
protect Azeroth. Hope: Bring stability (even by force). Fear: Unleashing the depths of her anger and
the hatred in her heart. Jaina is torn between mercy and wrath (she once tried to save Theramore,
now teeters on fury). 
Aspects: “Lady of the Waves and Master of Ice”, “Grappling with Old Hatreds”, “Champion of the Alliance”. 
Stunts: Arcane Assault: Once per scene, Jaina may create a free Invoke on an Elemental Aspect (e.g. 
“Frost Nova” on enemies, slowing them). Shielding Presence: She adds +2 to defend any one ally
against magical attack per scene (like Intervene magic-wise). 
Roleplay Tips: Diplomatic and regretful. Early on, she may speak with pain (“I should have stopped
Varian from charging!”). Allow her to struggle with vengeance (consider compelling “Driven by Rage”
if she wants to annihilate Horde too harshly). Later she can show tenderness to allies (healing
mercies). Her leadership means PCs might work under her banner in naval or Kul Tiras campaigns. If
PCs question her harsh orders, it could be a moral conflict.
Tyrande Whisperwind, Night Warrior of Elune (Alliance)
Profile: Ancient Night Elf leader, recently touched by the Night Warrior. Motivation: Protect her
people and punish Sylvanas for Teldrassil. Hope: Honor Elune and preserve Azeroth’s balance. Fear:
Losing her moral compass or failing Elune’s trust. She is fierce, principled, and haunted by vision. 
Aspects: “High Priestess of Elune”, “Avenger of the Burning”, “Eyes of the Night Warrior”. 
Stunts: Night’s Embrace: Once per session, Tyrande can grant one ally the “Blessing of Elune”,
removing a Fatigue or enabling a +2 on a hunt/stealth roll. Moonfire Strike: She may attempt a free
Flashy attack against a weakened foe in darkness (Create Advantage “Covered by Moonlight”). 
Roleplay Tips: Proud and wrathful. Early game she may seem cold and accusing (compel “Hateful
Revenge” Aspect if PCs try to restrain her). In private she can express doubts to Priest characters. If a
PC shares her hatred (e.g. an Alliance who lost family), she might mentor them. Tyrande can
confront Sylvanas in battle; she must not be killed by players, but let Tyrande engage her as a
dramatic standoff.
(All NPCs above can have Approaches/Skills assigned as needed: e.g., Sylvanas +4 Stealth, Anduin +4 Empathy,
Jaina +5 Lore. The above Aspects/Stunts capture their essence.)
Campaign Outline
The module is divided into Chapters/Acts, each covering key events of BFA from the War of the Thorns
through the final confrontation. PCs may be on either side of the war (Alliance or Horde), and many scenes
“branch”: Alliance-party and Horde-party have different vantage scenes for the same event. Where possible,
allow player agency to shape outcomes (e.g., saving allies, negotiating with minor factions, choosing
targets). Note that major story-critical NPCs (Sylvanas, Anduin, etc.) are effectively invulnerable to•

death unless you plan it as a final epic; however, other named NPCs and generals can die or survive
based on PC choices, with lasting impact.
Each Act includes suggested Scenes and Scenario Prompts. Use these to guide play, but feel free to
improvise or reorder based on player choices. Key scenes are bullet-listed; bullet notes (–) indicate GM
prompts, alternative outcomes, or mechanical hints.
Act I: The War of the Thorns (Teldrassil)
Setting the stage: The Horde (led by Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner) has razed the World Tree Teldrassil,
igniting outrage across Azeroth. The Alliance reels from this betrayal; King Anduin must rally his people.
Introduce PCs by thrusting them into the opening chaos. 
Scene – Horde Council in Orgrimmar: (Horde PCs) Sylvanas convenes with her top generals
(Saurfang, Nathanos, Rokhan). The PCs (as Horde champions) are asked to plan the war campaign.
Roleplay a tense debate: Saurfang urges caution and honor, while Sylvanas demands vengeance. 
Prompt: If players challenge Sylvanas’s methods, Sylvanas might test their loyalty (Compel
“Questioned Loyalty” to force a show of faith). Otherwise Sylvanas might offer them a high command
(Aspect “Entrusted by the Warchief”).
Scene – Alliance War Council in Stormwind: (Alliance PCs) Anduin, Khadgar (or Jaina, if Dalaran is
still with Horde), and generals (Magni, Vereesa) mourn Teldrassil. PCs advise strategy: give orders to
retake Undercity or defend borders. Prompt: Weave in an NPC like Talanji (Zandalari regent allied to
the Horde) as a neutral trader for intelligence. PCs can secure an alliance or mistrust her. If PCs
propose a reckless assault, compel “Rash Youth” Aspect on Anduin to show anger.
Scene – Race to Rescue Gilneans: Darkshore erupts in war. If Alliance PCs, they may lead a mission
to evacuate Gilneans fleeing Darkshore, defending them from Forsaken raiders (Action: contest
involving zones on a sinking dock). If Horde PCs, they might pursue these refugees (testing their
tactics and ethics). Prompt: Success: earn a Boost “Evacuated Survivors”. Failure: a crowd perishes
(NPC casualty, generating a “Guilt” Aspect).
Scene – Teldrassil Ashes: A cinematic tableau – either Horde PCs observe from a distance as
Sylvanas’s forces burn the tree, or Alliance PCs arrive afterward to see the devastation (perhaps
retrieving a survivor or a loved one’s body). Emphasize emotion. Prompt: Allow PCs a chance to save a
fleeing Night Elf (create an Advantage) or mourn a comrade. Use this to compel personal stakes (e.g.
a PC from Teldrassil gains aspect “Survivor of the Burning”).
Decisions and Consequences: After Teldrassil’s fall, each side must choose: vengeance vs mercy.
Alliance may decide to strike back (setting up Lordaeron), while Horde doubles down. The peace
shatters. Introduce an optional Faction Choice Aspect like “Allies Turned Enemies” and compel it in
scenes. One PC dying here (or an allied NPC) should carry a narrative weight (grant a Fate Point on
heroic sacrifice ). 
(Interlude suggestion: That night, Alliance PCs might have a camp scene mourning losses; Horde PCs might
bitterly toast victory – each an opportunity for small character Aspects like “My Brothers Are Fallen” or “No
Regrets”).2

Act II: Siege of Lordaeron (Battle for Undercity)
The Alliance strikes back by marching on Lordaeron to deny Sylvanas a foothold. This act covers the fall of
the Undercity and internal strife in the Horde.
Scene – Siege Planning (Stormwind vs Orgrimmar): Alliance side: PCs plan the Siege with Anduin/
Jaina in Stormwind; Horde side: PCs in Orgrimmar decide how to defend or counter-strike. Prompt: A
secret spy NPC could offer Horde players info on Alliance plans – trusting or not is a gamble. For
Alliance, maybe recruit Blood Elves or Darkspear support via diplomacy (Testing Rapport). 
Scene – Battle at the Ruins of Lordaeron: Huge battle scene. Use large-scale Conflict rules
(multiple zones: Royal Quarter, Sewers, Cathedral, etc.). Alliance PCs may lead Stormwind forces
down Pyrewood (zone 1), Horde PCs may hold the walls (zone 2) or harass flanks. Prompt: If PCs play
Alliance: allow a heroic moment to confront Nathanos or Sylvanas. If Horde: allow an NPC save (e.g.
Sylvanas escapes on a zip-line leaving Nathanos). Fate Tip: give leaders like Saurfang or Sylvanas a
Stress track; let them take Moderate hits (they are tough). If Saurfang falls, that’s major (consider
handing an aspect like “Never Forget Saurfang” for mourners).
Scene – Confrontation with Sylvanas: If Alliance PCs reach deep enough, they confront Sylvanas.
She fights them fiercely. Prompt: Sylvanas’s Aspect “Enemy of the Alliance” allows her to gain +2
when attacking or defending vs Alliance. Anduin should be on scene (aiding in defense). Let PCs 
compel “Queen of Cinders” on Sylvanas – maybe if she fails to kill an ally, she collapses into rage and
takes a consequence. She never dies here, but maybe she ends the fight by abandoning Undercity
(As she does canonically, destroying everything). PCs could negotiate with her or capture her, but
fate (your call) tends to let her escape into darkness (perhaps on the Mausoleum’s rooftop, where
Jaina had confronted her in lore).
Scene – Aftermath & Moral Choice: With Undercity lost, tensions flare. Horde PCs may meet with
Saurfang or Vol’jin’s ghost demanding Sylvanas’s trial. Alliance PCs debate whether to finish Sylvanas.
Prompt: Use an Aspect like “Blood on Your Hands” if PCs consider mercy vs justice. If PCs decide to
spare Sylvanas (Alliance) or defy Sylvanas (Horde), the campaign should branch accordingly. A PC-
aligned decision here (e.g. overthrow Sylvanas) can be very powerful (grant a Major Reward – see
Rewards below).
(Interlude suggestion: Jaina or Thrall (if introduced) might walk away with an ally PC after battle. A quiet scene in
which they reflect on war’s cost could set romance or friendship tones.)
Act III: War Fronts and Blood Campaigns
The war rages across multiple fronts. Each faction sends champions to various theaters. We provide 2–4
assault arcs per faction, treating them as mini-campaigns. Players can lead troops or sabotage enemy
cities, choosing where to strike.
Alliance Arcs:
Stormgarde Warfront (Arathi Highlands): PCs serve under Khadgar or Vereesa to capture
Stromgarde from Horde loyalists. Scenes include “Siege of Stromgarde Keep” (Action: assault walls vs
undead army), and a showdown with a traitorous Dark Iron dwarf leader. Success secures a powerful
base (Aspect “Shield of the North”, free invoke in final battle). Failure means Valkyr or Horde
reinforcements arrive (Consequence: Quartermaster NPC dies). •

Liberation of Darkshore: PCs escort civilians out of Ashenvale/Darkshore from Horde rangers.
Scenes: ferry mission across sea (Contests on a boat ride vs naga ambush), then ground fight at
Ameth’Aran. Theme: elven kinship. Outcome may earn an Elven ally or a new aspect “Queen
Tyrande’s Blessing”. 
Stranglethorn Alliance: Using Azerite intelligence, PCs infiltrate or assault the Jungle (perhaps
capture Razorfen Horde or troll power). Scenes: Jungle ambush, fighting Gurubashi cultists. Gain a
troll ally (Spiritwalker Rokhan) or deny an ally to Horde. Reward: moderate if successful (recruit
Rokhan, unlocking Dazar’alor secret).
Horde Arcs:
Battle for Zuldazar (Dazar’alor): Horde must defend the Zandalari capital while dealing with civil
unrest. Scenes: Hold the Gates of Zuldazar (Action: siege defense) and optional meeting with
Rastakhan. Prompt: If Alliance PCs play this (i.e. they lead an assault), they storm under-altar / slums,
facing Zul’s minions. A critical choice: Spare Queen Talanji (consort) or kill her? Outcome: Rastakhan’s
fate (the king can die or remain alive based on players’ mercy) shaping Horde morale. 
Stormsong Valley (Kul Tiras Campaign): Horde envoys (perhaps with Sylvanas’s blessing) attempt
to disrupt Kul Tiras. Scenes: Naval skirmishes, sabotage an Azerite refinery. NPC: Admiral Moore or
Admiral Aldan controlling. Prompt: Introduce a tidal dragonflight conflict (reflecting Jaina’s influence);
PCs can choose to ally with local Kraken/Gnoll tribes or seize tech for Horde (Result: either a Trollship
Horde vehicle or enraged Kul Tirans; reward/penalty as appropriate). 
Marshes of Nazmir: Horde fights the Blood Trolls of G’huun. Scenes: Explore an ancient Zul temple
(with puzzles), confront a Highpriest creature. Outcome: gaining a troll bloodhound or Azerite
trinket. This rewards Horde PCs with a secret “Shadowlands Corruption” Aspect for final fiasco if they
fail (drawback) or an ally if succeed.
Each arc should have two main Action Scenes (combat vs Horde/Alliance NPCs or creatures) and at least one
Dramatic Scene (negotiation with a local faction or a twisted tribe). Reward player creativity: e.g. letting Sylvanas
swoop in with Blight or Anduin rallying Argussian druids for the Alliance, based on PCs prior choices.
Failure in these arcs isn’t final death, but it costs faction resources (e.g. an allied NPC general might die, or a
region falls to the enemy). Success grants an Aspect or troop bonus in later battles. Eg: “Kul Tiras Reclaimed”
(Alliance victory) gives free invokes on sea fights; “Nazmir Secured” grants +2 Fate for Horde PCs in swamp
terrains.
Act IV: The Turning Point – Dazar’alor and the Zandalar Assault
This act covers the climactic attack on enemy capitals and major faction gambits.
Scene – Battle of Dazar’alor (Zandalar): Two parallel scenes: Alliance Assault and Horde Defense. 
Alliance PCs: Lead the charge into Dazar’alor’s docks under siege. Confront Rastakhan and Baine. 
Prompt: A key choice: kill King Rastakhan (legitimized by a hateful turban) or spare him (Bang). Killing
him (canon) causes great shock and a brief halt; sparing him might earn Zandalari aid. A scripted
duel vs Baine or an ally’s intervention can occur. Sylvanas must not die here, but Alliance PCs can
chase her across rooftops. If an Alliance PC injures Sylvanas, have her issue a Dark Gambit (remove a
Major Aspect from a PC as revenge next scene). •

Horde PCs: Defend the city. A plague or elemental (N’raqi) strikes. PCs may choose to hold lines or
retreat. Prompt: Choose between saving civilians or reinforcing a weak gate. Unsuccessful defense
results in city partially falling (Aspect “Broken Walls of Dazar’alor” ). In the palace, hold off Alliance
intruders (an NPC ally – Queen Talanji – is wounded). 
Scene – Aftermath and Mak’gora: Both sides react: Alliance celebrates partial victory; Horde
laments losses. Underworld threads converge: Saurfang confronts Sylvanas at Orgrimmar’s Gates in
a scripted Mak’gora. Prompt (optional): Allow PCs to intervene or influence this duel. For instance, a
Horde PC could pull Saurfang away before death (granting a major reward: Saurfang lives on as a
mentor with Aspect “Guided by Saurfang” ). If Sylvanas wins unopposed, Horde morale shatters.
Saurfang’s death (canon) can be a doom-clock effect (filling segments of a “Horde Demoralization”
tracker). Use a Fate Countdown: e.g. 4 segments of Horde loyalty; each failure in scenes advances it. 
Scene – Council of War: The alliance leadership meets (real or through visions of leaders). A crucial
decision: pursue Sylvanas further or consolidate? Similarly, Horde leadership (if it still exists)
squabbles: some call for deposing Sylvanas (Saurfang’s faction) or renewed aggression. PCs’ actions
can empower one faction. Prompt: If Alliance PCs spared Sylvanas earlier, they might be pressured
(“What if she strikes again?”). For Horde PCs, a surviving NPC like Baine or Agatha may contest
Sylvanas (creating a civil War scene). The consequences here set up the final act’s starting state
(Horde unity fractured or reneged, Alliance determined to hunt Sylvanas).
Act V: The Depths of Nazjatar and Azshara’s Assault
The final act culminates the Old God threat and brings closure.
Scene – Descent into Nazjatar: Following prophecy, brave PCs may venture beneath the waves.
Assist Rastakhan’s shades and Azsharan tyrants. Confront Yazma or Je’lissa (Nazjatar bosses). Prompt:
In Nazjatar’s ancient temple, PCs might encounter N’Zoth’s whispers (compel them with “One With
the Void” when tempted by immense power). They might rescue Ysera’s shade (if introduced in prior
lore). Outcome: Freeing Ysera (canon) grants PC an Aspect “Dream’s Light Guides Me” for a crucial
defense, but failure means PCs gain a Dark Consequence (nightmarish visions). 
Scene – The Crown of Azshara: The final confrontation with Queen Azshara (or save the world from
the Old God). This should be a dramatic confrontation and/or a final big battle. Perhaps Azshara
summons N’Zoth’s avatar – a monstrous fight. PCs’ past deeds matter: invoke all gathered allied
Aspects (e.g. “Blessing of Elune”, “Thalassian Oath”, etc. from earlier success). This is the grand finale: if
PCs succeed (maybe aided by the Tide Stalls or Liadrin’s artifact), Azeroth is saved. If the campaign
continues into Shadowlands, this might conclude BFA and set up the epilogue.
Prompt: Allow a hidden “Legendary Reward”: defeating Azshara might drop her Tear of Elune as an
item-Aspect (e.g. “Tear of Elune – Nullifies Undead Aspect” for a short time), or grant the PCs’
faction a lasting world boon (a secret reward).
Epilogue / Aftermath: War-weary Azeroth stands on a precipice. Depending on choices (and a final
Fate contest if needed), decide Sylvanas’s fate. For example, an optional epilogue scene: PCs
confront Sylvanas alone. She fights one last time (or yields if cornered). If players spare her, she can
escape to Shadowlands (mirroring canon); if they defeat her, Horde falls into turmoil (an extreme
change, but a valid “major decision” ). In any case, underscore that NPC death matters: non-critical•

NPCs who died should have had scenes mourning them (an Aspect “Mourning <Name>” ). Let
survivors (Anduin, Baine, etc.) honor fallen heroes or forge new alliances. Show how personal arcs
resolve: Jaina and Thrall (if Thrall appears) might share a quiet dialogue; Baine returns to Thunder
Bluff to heal; a PC might receive a knighthood or Horde medal.
Scenes and Prompts (Sample)
Throughout the acts, use Fate Scenes with custom challenges. Examples:
Dungeon Crawl / Assault: “The Ruins of Moonfall” – PCs infiltrate a desecrated temple seeking an
Artifact. Create Aspects like “Fallen Statue of Elune” on obstacles. Allow players to create advantages
(e.g. blow a dust column for surprise) or face Compels (vampiric spirits attack with +2 Lore). Use skill
rolls (e.g. Lore to decipher murals, Athletics to leap gaps) and impose Consequences (Cold, Scorched,
Haunted) to track wounds.
Social Encounter: “The Zandalarian Council” – PCs negotiate with King Rastakhan or Queen Azshara.
Set high Stakes: failing could cause an Old God ritual to accelerate. Players can use Rapport or
Empathy, aided by earlier favors (Aspects like “Saved the Zandalari” ). A tie might force a tricky
compromise; success might convert a neutral faction. Twists: an assassination attempt in council
hall, a sudden invasion.
Race Against Doom: Introduce a Doom Clock (e.g. a 6-segment tracker for “The Burning Azerite” ).
Every delay or failure in side quests fills it, escalating war (each 2 segments triggers a calamity: a city
falls or a major NPC takes a Consequence). PCs must juggle urgent tasks vs global war goals.
Romantic/Dramatic Interlude: “Campfire in Hillsbrad” – Mid-campaign, allow an optional downtime
scene. Two PCs (or PC+NPC) share their fears (roll Will vs PC’s Compelling Aspect “Lost All I Love”).
Success yields mutual confidences (new Boost Aspect like “Together in the Dark” ); failure creates a
complication (fearful secret revealed).
Moral Duel: “Spear of War” – A duel between PCs (or a PC and NPC) to resolve a conflict of honor.
Each participant can use Physique or Will, plus Aspects (e.g. “Heir to Defias”) to sway. The stakes
could be oath vs blood debt. Outcomes range from winning an ally’s loyalty to fracturing a party if a
player falls.
Throughout, scale difficulty by adjusting opposition skill levels or consequences. For new players, focus on
narrative success-with-cost rather than punishing rolls. For veterans, throw complex contests (multiple tight
Fate exchanges) with rivals like Nathanos or Azshara.
Reward System
Rather than mundane XP, we use a tiered reward scheme to fit Warcraft flavor:
Minor Reward: Earning a Fate Point, a small Azerite trinket (Extra granting +2 bonus in a specific
situation), or a one-time free invoke on an Aspect.
Moderate Reward: A new Aspect (e.g. “Hero of Stromgarde” or “Blessed by Elune” ) or a useful Stunt
(one-shot ability). PCs might recover a well-known item (e.g. a Feldrake Feather for quick flight).
Major Reward: A powerful unique weapon or armor (Extra) with its own Aspects/Stunts (e.g.
*“Stormspeaker Staff” – casts Lightning Bolt once per scene), or a boon like leadership over a small
allied army (NPC roster).•

Legendary Reward: A game-changing artifact or destiny. Example: the crown of Talanji confers
leadership of Zandalari (Aspect “King of Zandalar” and grants 2 free Fate Points each session). Or PCs
could each gain a companion NPC (e.g. Liadrin as a fan-follower).
Secret Reward: Hidden boons unlocked by subplots. For instance, if a PC helps a mysterious Old
God cult survive, they gain “Favor of the Deep”, a secret Aspect only revealed late-game (it might
backfire!). Use Fate System Toolkit guidelines for special rewards, or simply narrate a world-altering
consequence (like claiming an entire territory).
Always tie rewards to story and mechanics: if a player heroically saves lives, maybe a grateful NPC offers a
Minor Reward or form an allegiance (a Faction Aspect ). If they achieve an epic feat (like capturing
Lordaeron intact), grant a Major Reward. Conversely, failure can yield Dark Rewards (Awaken a dread power,
forcing a new enemy).
Fate Core Notes
Aspects & Invokes: Tag paragraphs with aspects early (battlefields, motivations) so players can
invoke them later. For example, after Stormwind’s banners burn, place an aspect “Flames of
Teldrassil” on Stormwind’s symbol and compel it (Alliance PCs suffer guilt) or invoke it (Horde PCs
gain fury).
Consequences: Use all three types: Minor, Moderate, Severe. Injuries (Broken Leg), Fatigue
(Exhausted), or mental scars (Nightmares) all consume slots. E.g., a PC who fails to save a friend
might gain a Moderate Con “Haunted by Guilt” – which will matter when they face Elune’s priests or
Shadow magic.
Stunts Usage: Allow PCs to create character-specific Stunts in Session Zero (draw from Fate Core
rules). For example, a Dwarf PC might have “Master of the Forge: +2 to Create Advantage for any
crafting or barrier creation.” These help tie flavor.
Clocks and Contests: Use Fate contests for prolonged struggles (e.g. controlling an outcome:
Alliance vs Horde capturing an artifact). Use clocks (from Fate Toolkit) to visualize progress or war
clock: e.g. a 10-segment clock for “Race to Stormwind” (time til Horde fleet arrives).
Scaling: To adjust for new/veteran players, vary stunt refresh rates or fate point availability. For
hardcore, allow more GM compels; for newcomers, encourage invocations.
Finally, remember the Legion module’s advice: Fate Core is flexible and story-first. Keep the war’s
“core beats” (Teldrassil burning, Undercity siege, warfront victories, Dazar’alor, Azshara) but welcome player
ingenuity. If the heroes decide some off-lore gambit (e.g. allying with surviving Legion demons to attack the
Old Gods), make it a contest and see where it leads. The GM should never railroad the PCs – the story is king.
By integrating Fate’s narrative tools and the rich lore of BfA, this campaign module aims to create an epic
yet personal tale of war, sacrifice, and destiny. PCs will rise as champions or fall to darkness, and each Fate
Point and consequence carries the weight of Azeroth’s future. “Embrace your fate” – the Fourth War
awaits.
