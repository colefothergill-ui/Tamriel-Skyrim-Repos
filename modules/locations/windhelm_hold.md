# Windhelm Hold

**Capital:** Windhelm  
**Jarl:** Ulfric Stormcloak  
**Strategic Importance:** Stormcloak headquarters; ancient city of the first Nordic king

---

## Key Locations

### Windhelm City
- **Palace of the Kings** — Ulfric's seat of power
- **Gray Quarter** — Dunmer (Dark Elf) ghetto; racial tension high
- **Docks** — Trade and smuggling

**Aspects:**
- *Heart of the Rebellion*
- *Ancient Nord Pride and Modern Prejudice*
- *City of the First King*

**Meditation Spots:**
- The Hall of the Dead — ancestral tombs, Nordic tradition
- City walls at night — watch for Imperial attack

---

### Palace of the Kings
**Ulfric's War Room**

The nerve center of the Stormcloak rebellion. Strategy, speeches, and Nordic oaths.

**Aspects:**
- *War Council in Session*
- *Galmar Stone-Fist's Bluntness*
- *Ulfric's Thu'um Whispers* (subtle intimidation)

**Key NPCs:**
- Ulfric Stormcloak (Jarl, rebellion leader)
- Galmar Stone-Fist (Ulfric's second)
- Jorleif (steward)

**Memory Echoes:**
The throne room where High King Torygg was slain in single combat — the air still feels heavy.

---

### Gray Quarter
**Dunmer Refugee District**

Dark Elves driven from Morrobar by Red Year disaster. Nords tolerate them; do not welcome them.

**Aspects:**
- *Racial Resentment Simmering*
- *Refugee Dignity in Poverty*
- *Potential Alliance or Blind Spot*

**Reflective Zone:**
The Cornerclub at midnight — Dunmer stories of lost homeland

## Strategic Notes

- Windhelm is the Stormcloak capital
- Ulfric's victory depends on taking Solitude
- Racial tensions could be exploited by Thalmor or PCs
- City is fortified but not unassailable

---

## GM Hooks

- Gray Quarter residents may aid or hinder PCs based on civil war stance
- Thalmor agents embedded in the city (Ulfric paranoia is justified)
- Blood on the Ice serial killer subplot (optional)
- Ulfric's use of the Thu'um is controversial — some see it as dishonorable
