# Solitude Hold (Haafingar)

**Capital:** Solitude  
**Jarl:** Elisif the Fair (Imperial puppet; General Tullius holds real power)  
**Strategic Importance:** Imperial headquarters; seat of the High King

---

## Key Locations

### Solitude City
- **Castle Dour** — Imperial Legion HQ
- **The Blue Palace** — Jarl's seat (mostly ceremonial)
- **Bards College** — Cultural center; maintains neutrality
- **The Winking Skeever** — Tavern; rumor mill

**Aspects:**
- *Imperial Stronghold of the North*
- *Widow Queen Under Legion Control*
- *Cultural Heart vs Military Reality*

**Meditation Spots:**
- Bards College courtyard — music transcends war
- Blue Palace garden at dawn — Elisif's grief

---

### Castle Dour
**General Tullius's War Room**

The Imperial Legion's northern command. Discipline, logistics, and pragmatism.

**Aspects:**
- *Military Efficiency Over Politics*
- *Tullius's Blunt Pragmatism*
- *Thalmor "Advisors" Lurking*

**Key NPCs:**
- General Tullius (Legion commander)
- Legate Rikke (Tullius's second; Nord torn by war)
- Elisif the Fair (grieving widow, nominal ruler)

**Memory Echoes:**
Courtyard where Roggvir was executed for opening the gates for Ulfric after Torygg's death — still divides the city.

---

### Blue Palace
**Jarl Elisif's Court**

Elisif mourns Torygg. Court is ceremonial; real power is at Castle Dour.

**Aspects:**
- *Widow Queen's Grief*
- *Ceremonial Authority Only*
- *Court Intrigue and Thalmor Presence*

**Reflective Zone:**
Elisif's private balcony — overlooks city she rules in name only

## Strategic Notes

- Solitude is the Imperial capital in Skyrim
- Heavily fortified; hardest city to take
- Tullius is pragmatic and effective
- Thalmor have significant influence here (embarrassment for Tullius)

---

## GM Hooks

- Thalmor Embassy nearby (espionage opportunities)
- Execution platform — public spectacle and morale weapon
- Bards College as neutral ground for secret meetings
- Wolf Queen awakening subplot (Potema's catacombs)
