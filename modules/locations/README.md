# Locations Module

This directory contains location guides for holds, cities, and significant sites across Skyrim.

---

## Purpose

Location files serve as:
- Quick reference for GMs during sessions
- Aspect banks for scene-building
- Meditation spots and memory echoes for atmospheric moments
- Zone-in commands for session starts

---

## Structure

Each location file includes:
- **Strategic importance** — Why this place matters to the campaign
- **Key locations** — Specific sites within the hold/city
- **Aspects** — Fate Core aspects that define the place
- **Meditation spots** — Quiet zones for reflection and character moments
- **Memory echoes** — Atmospheric touches tied to the setting's history
- **Reflective zones** — Places that symbolize themes or character arcs
- **GM hooks** — Story complications and plot threads
- **Zone-in commands** — Quick session-start references

---

## Available Locations

- `whiterun_hold.md` — Central Skyrim; neutral ground under pressure
- `windhelm_hold.md` — Stormcloak capital; ancient Nord pride
- `solitude_hold.md` — Imperial stronghold; military vs ceremonial power
- **TODO:** Add files for other holds as campaign expands

---

## Usage During Play

When PCs arrive at a location:
1. Read the **Aspects** to set the scene
2. Use **Meditation spots** for downtime or character moments
3. Check **GM hooks** for complications to introduce
4. Note **Memory echoes** for atmospheric flavor

---

## Zone-In Commands

Quick session starts:
```
ZONE-IN: [Hold/City]
LOCATION: [Specific site]
TONE: [calm/tense/urgent/mysterious]
```

Example:
```
ZONE-IN: Whiterun
LOCATION: Jorrvaskr
TONE: tense
```

GM improvises opening based on current campaign state and chosen tone.

## Expanding Locations

When adding new location files:

- Include aspects, meditation spots, and GM hooks
- Link to relevant NPCs and factions
- Add zone-in command examples
