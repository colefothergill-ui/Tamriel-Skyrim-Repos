Act II: Spreading Flames – War on Multiple Fronts
Summary: In Act II, the civil war escalates and engulfs multiple holds. After the clash at Whiterun, both
sides mobilize for broader campaigns. The PCs will experience military engagements in two or more
regions, and we’ll delve into city-based story arcs in those locales. If the PCs are Stormcloak-aligned, they
will focus on liberating Imperial-controlled holds (like Falkreath Hold and The Reach), whereas Imperial-
aligned PCs will concentrate on crushing rebellion in Stormcloak territories (such as the Rift and The Pale).
Neutral faction PCs may choose or be thrust into one front or shuttle between them. Act II features at least
two major battles or operations, each tied to a hold capital and accompanied by a Side Plot B – a subplot of
intrigue or supernatural meddling that occurs in parallel with the military action. These side plots not only
add depth and variety (investigation, diplomacy, or dungeon-crawl style encounters), but also begin to
reveal the covert work of the Thalmor (or other forces) behind the scenes. By the end of Act II, the war’s
brutality will be on full display, one or two more cities will have changed hands, and the PCs should start
suspecting that someone is manipulating events for their own gain 12 .
Act II Structure: This act can be played somewhat non-linearly. Depending on player choices, they might
tackle objectives in a different order. We present two primary “campaigns” in Act II – one for each faction
perspective – but GMs can intercut them or adapt as needed. Also consider geography: the holds targeted
often border the one taken in Act I. For example, if Stormcloaks hold Whiterun now, they might strike west
into The Reach (Markarth) next, or south into Falkreath. If Imperials solidified Whiterun, they likely push
east into The Rift (Riften) or north into The Pale (Dawnstar). We’ll detail two major operations: Operation
Hammerfall (Stormcloak liberation of The Reach) and Operation Shadowfang (Imperial offensive in
The Rift) as representative arcs. GMs can swap these if different holds make more sense or use them as
templates for other holds (e.g., an Imperial operation in Winterhold would have similarities to the Rift plan
but different flavor).
Throughout Act II, maintain the theme of war spreading like wildfire. Show refugees on the roads, new
local militias rising, and how everyday life is disrupted in each hold. And in each location, highlight city-
specific unrest or questlines that can entangle the PCs. The side plots will tie into Daedric or faction
intrigue – the Thalmor’s hand might not be obvious yet, but careful PCs could notice a pattern (e.g., in every
hold, some chaos occurs that conveniently weakens that hold’s ability to fight, benefitting the Thalmor’s
goal of prolonging conflict).
Stormcloak Campaign – “Operation Hammerfall” (Liberating the Reach)
Setting the Stage (Stormcloak context): With Whiterun in Stormcloak hands (assuming Act I outcome for
Stormcloaks), Ulfric turns his eyes westward to the Reach, the hold of Markarth. The Reach is a rich prize –
its silver mines and strategic position are vital. It’s also symbolic: Ulfric’s rebellion traces back to the
Markarth Incident, where he once liberated the city from Reachmen (Forsworn) only to be betrayed by the
Empire’s concordat with the Thalmor 23 24 . Now Markarth is held by Jarl Igmund, a young Imperial
loyalist, and heavily garrisoned by Legion troops and local militia (the Silver-Blood mercenaries). Ulfric
codenames the plan to take The Reach “Operation Hammerfall” – a nod to Shor’s sacred hammer and the
idea of smashing Imperial power in the west. The Stormcloak army will need to capture strategic forts (such
as Fort Sungard or Fort Greenwall – though Fort Greenwall is in the Rift, you can adapt fort names as
needed) to cut off Markarth, then besiege the city. PCs are likely to be at the forefront, given their
achievements at Whiterun.
14
Before the main assault, there’s a briefing in Windhelm (or in Whiterun if Ulfric moved his court there
temporarily to command). Ulfric addresses his war council, including Galmar (nursing some wounds if he
survived Whiterun) and the PC Stormcloaks. Galmar growls that the Reachmen (Forsworn) are also active in
the hills, complicating things: “Those Forsworn devils hate the Nords and the Empire both – they’ll surely try
to murder us as we march in, or worse, strike Markarth amid the chaos.” Ulfric tasks the PCs with a crucial
preliminary mission: to secure the Karth River valley approach so the main army can move. This might
involve taking Fort Sungard (an old fortress on a hill in the Reach) or clearing a large Forsworn camp that
could ambush their supply line. Essentially, the PCs must handle a mid-sized battle or infiltration to pave
the way for the larger siege. This can be a classic Dungeon/Combat scenario using Fate challenges.
Scene 1 (Stormcloak): Clearing Fort Sungard / Dealing with the Forsworn
The Forsworn are a tribal insurgent faction of rebellious natives in the Reach. They are neither friend to
Stormcloaks nor Imperials, seeking to reclaim their land from all Nords. This presents an interesting dynamic:
The PCs could attempt to negotiate with Forsworn leaders (perhaps promising them autonomy or rights if
Ulfric wins) or simply fight them as enemies. The module encourages a chance for diplomacy, albeit risky –
it’s an opportunity for a politically-minded PC to shine. Ulfric privately doesn’t mind if the Forsworn get
slaughtered (they’ve terrorized Nord settlers), but a PC might see value in neutralizing them through a
truce.
Option A – Combat Route: The PCs lead a strike team to Fort Sungard, currently occupied by a mix of
Imperial scouts and Forsworn who have taken advantage of the region’s instability. It’s a nighttime raid
under torchlight. Battlefield Aspects: Narrow mountain trails, bone totems that induce fear (Forsworn
magic), and the fort’s crumbling walls (easy to climb in spots). This can be run as a contest or challenge:
the PCs must secure three key areas (the outer wall, the courtyard, the fort interior). Each key area can be
an overcome action or small conflict. For example: - Outer Wall: Sneak up and silently take out the lookout
archers (Stealth or Fight). Success = they gain entry quietly (Aspect “Surprise Gained” for next fight). Failure
= alarm sounded, they face a volley of arrows as they climb (each PC might have to roll Athletics to avoid a
minor hit).
- Courtyard Skirmish: Forsworn barbarians and perhaps a domesticated bear (! why not?) rush them. One PC
might handle the bear (a Create Advantage to scare it off or Acrobatics to lead it into a trap pit). Others duel
the Forsworn. They notice some Imperial soldiers’ corpses staked on pikes here – evidence the Forsworn
overcame an Imperial patrol earlier. This scene seeds the cruelty of the Forsworn.
- Interior Showdown: In the fort’s central hall, a Forsworn Briarheart shaman leads a ritual around a
captured Imperial officer, intending a blood sacrifice to their Daedra (perhaps Hagraven totem to the
Daedric Prince Hircine or Namira). The Briarheart has a literal briar heart (magical) granting him resilience –
an aspect “Briarheart’s Regeneration” that PCs might overcome by specifically targeting it (a called shot
type action). During the fight, the shaman might unleash a burst of nature magic – e.g., vines erupt from
the stone floor (Aspect “Entangling Vines” to complicate movement). Once the PCs defeat him (or he
escapes via secret tunnel if you want a recurring villain), the fort is theirs. They can choose to free the
captured Imperial officer or not; that officer could yield intel (like Markarth’s gate codes or number of
legionaries inside Markarth). Freeing them might seem odd (a Stormcloak killing Imperials normally), but if
a PC has a kind heart, this Imperial’s gratitude could become useful later (maybe he defects or helps reduce
needless bloodshed in the final siege).
After victory, they raise the bear-banner over Fort Sungard. A Stormcloak courier rushes to Ulfric with news
that the way is clear. The PCs might also find clues here: perhaps a Thalmor order on the dead Imperial
officer indicating he was tasked to watch for Thalmor sightings (Legate Fasendil’s influence – a nod that
15
even the Empire suspects Thalmor meddling 22 ). Or they discover the Forsworn were equipped with
unusually fine steel arrows – bearing an Elven make. Could it be the Thalmor quietly armed the Forsworn to
harass both sides? (This is indeed a plausible thing – weaken the Reach by encouraging conflict between
Nords and Reachmen, something the Thalmor would smile upon.) PCs might deduce or at least note the
oddity.
Option B – Diplomatic Route: The PCs decide to parley with the Forsworn rather than attack. Perhaps they
send a scout ahead with a white flag. The Forsworn leader is a hagraven or chieftain named e.g. Cadius the
Crow-Eyed. Arrange a meeting on neutral ground – perhaps a stone circle atop a cliff at dusk, with
Forsworn painted warriors watching from above. This negotiation is extremely tense; use Opposed
Rapport/Deceive vs. Insight. The Forsworn want Markarth for themselves. They view Ulfric’s lot as no
better than the Empire – both persecuted them. A clever PC might promise that if Stormcloaks win, they will
withdraw Nord settlers from some Redoubt areas or at least cease persecution of Forsworn worship.
(This is a big promise – perhaps a lie, which would be a Deception roll. If found out later, it could have
repercussions.) They could also point out a common enemy: “Why weaken ourselves fighting each other,
when the real enemy is the Thalmor who would kill both Nord and Reachman?” If they have evidence (like
that elven arrow or knowledge that Thalmor fear a united Skyrim), they might persuade the Forsworn to a
truce of convenience.
Likely outcomes: If successful, the Forsworn agree to sit out the battle for Markarth and not harass
Stormcloak supply lines (Aspect “Forsworn Truce”). They won’t fight alongside Nords, but even this
neutrality is a boon. Perhaps they even secretly give a token of trust: the PC negotiator receives a
reachmen talisman that can be shown to other Forsworn to grant safe passage. Mechanically, the PCs
earn an extra invoke or remove a potential obstacle from the siege (no Forsworn guerilla attacks). If the roll
fails badly or the PCs offend them (very possible, given cultural hatred), the meeting could explode into an
ambush. In that case, it shifts to combat with unfavorable positioning – maybe the PCs must retreat under
arrow fire or fight their way out of an encirclement. Surviving that, they’ll probably resort to Option A after
all, albeit with more difficulty (and perhaps one PC with a new arrow scar consequence).
Side Plot B – “The Forsworn Conspiracy” (Markarth Intrigue):
As the Stormcloak army marches toward Markarth for the big siege, an intriguing subplot unfolds within
the city’s stone walls. Markarth, the City of Stone, is rife with internal tension: the native Reachmen (some
secretly Forsworn sympathizers) versus Nord settlers, the ruling Silver-Blood family’s stranglehold on
commerce, and rumors of a Daedric presence in the haunted halls of Understone Keep. In Elder Scrolls V,
there is a quest named “The Forsworn Conspiracy” involving murders in Markarth orchestrated by Forsworn
agents in the city. We adapt a version of that here to give the PCs a chance for investigation or social
maneuvering either before the siege (if they can infiltrate the city) or during the siege as a parallel objective.
Premise: A series of mysterious murders has occurred in Markarth’s streets, targeting figures loyal to the
Jarl and Empire. The killer leaves a distinctive token – the engraved symbol of the Forsworn – on each
body. Panic and distrust grows in the city. Jarl Igmund’s men suspect a Forsworn sleeper cell is active,
possibly planning sabotage when the Stormcloaks arrive. In truth, the murders are being committed by
Forsworn agents (possibly led by an old man named Nepos the Nose, a respected citizen who is secretly a
Forsworn leader – as in the game). However, here’s the twist: the Thalmor know about it and have quietly
decided not to interfere (maybe even subtly encouraging it), because it serves their goal of weakening
Markarth’s defenses from within. If the PCs do nothing, this conspiracy could result in the city guard being
distracted or key figures killed right when the siege hits, causing more chaos (which helps prolong and
16
bloody the battle – a Thalmor win). So unraveling this plot can save lives and shorten the conflict – exactly
what the Thalmor don’t want. Thus, the Thalmor will covertly try to thwart any investigation, possibly via a
Thalmor operative in the city (a Justiciar posing as a diplomat).
How PCs engage: If Stormcloak PCs are outside, they might not directly investigate in the city before
capturing it. However, they could become aware of it via intel from sympathetic citizens or infiltrators.
Perhaps Elisif the Fair’s court in Solitude passed word to Ulfric that “something is amiss in Markarth –
murders blamed on Forsworn.” Ulfric, seeing an opportunity, could ask the PCs to contact the Forsworn (if
friendly) about it, or more pragmatically, to use the chaos to their advantage. But Ulfric wouldn’t care to
stop the murders (they hurt Imperial loyalists). It might fall on the PCs’ conscience: fewer innocents dead =
better moral high ground. Alternatively, if the PCs negotiated a truce with Forsworn outside, one Forsworn
druid might tip them off: “Some of our vengeful kin inside the city act tonight. Blood will flow in Markarth’s
streets.” That might spur them.
During the siege, if/when they breach Markarth, they could then actively seek out Nepos or others to stop a
hidden plan (perhaps the Forsworn agents intend to open the city gates at a specific time – helpful to
Stormcloaks actually! But they might also plan to massacre civilians or assassinate Jarl Igmund in the chaos,
which Ulfric might not want if he prefers to capture Igmund alive for legitimacy reasons). The PCs face a
choice: let the Forsworn cell run wild (makes victory easier but at cost of civilian lives and giving Forsworn a
foot-hold), or intervene to stabilize things (harder fight for them, but morally right and denies Thalmor a
messy prolonged urban conflict).
Key investigative scenes (if they undertake them):
- Discovering clues of the conspiracy: a note on a dead vigilant with Nepos’s name, or an encounter with
Eltrys (a citizen whose family was victimized) who begs them to look into it.
- Infiltrating Nepos’s house: if done stealthily during battle or just after victory, they might catch him
performing a dark Daedric ritual to Molag Bal or Namira, fueling the murderous rage of his followers.
Indeed, Markarth houses the abandoned house with Molag Bal’s shrine – maybe Nepos is working with a
Hagraven there to summon Daedric aid to slaughter Nord citizens as revenge. The PCs could storm that
mini-dungeon (a creepy horror-themed encounter with whispers of a Daedric prince).
- A confrontation with a Thalmor Justiciar: Perhaps Elenwen herself (or a lesser Thalmor like Ondolemar,
who in game is in Markarth as a Justiciar) steps in “to secure the Jarl’s safety” but subtly hinders the PCs. If
they recognize him as Thalmor, they might wonder why he’s not helping catch the Forsworn – maybe he
even tries to kill a Forsworn witness before they can talk. A chase or duel with a Thalmor agent in the
burning streets could be a thrilling aside. If captured, that Thalmor might smugly hint: “This war… we’ve
been watching. You have no idea how you’re dancing on our strings.” Most likely, he escapes to maintain the
bigger mystery.
Resolution: If PCs resolve the Forsworn conspiracy by Act II’s end (e.g., Nepos is defeated and his cell
dismantled, saving whoever was targeted like Jarl Igmund or Thane Thongvor), they effectively lessen
Thalmor influence here. Give them a benefit: Markarth’s civilian population is calmer, meaning maybe fewer
losses or the new Jarl (if Stormcloak, Thongvor Silver-Blood likely) has an easier time establishing order. If
they ignore it, Markarth post-battle is a nightmare of continued insurgency – which will occupy Stormcloak
resources for acts to come (maybe a compel in Act III about “Constant Unrest in Markarth” interfering with
their war plans).
Now, moving back to the military front:
17
Scene 2 (Stormcloak): Siege of Markarth – Stone and Silver
With Fort Sungard/Forsworn dealt with, the Stormcloaks surround Markarth. Markarth is unique: built into
a cliff of Dwemer ruins, with natural defenses. A single main gate crosses a bridge over a river chasm. It’s
hard to assault head-on. However, inside the city, unrest (the Forsworn conspiracy) may have weakened the
defense. PCs might implement strategies: scaling a side wall near the waterfall, sneaking through
Understone Keep’s dwemer ruins if they discovered an entrance, or using the classic Trojan Horse trick
(maybe captured caravan wagons from the Reach are rolled to the gate, filled with Stormcloak troops hiding
under hay). Let the players be creative. Use their earlier actions: if they allied with Forsworn, perhaps some
Forsworn in the city open a sally port for them (though that could lead to Forsworn also rampaging). If they
wiped out the Forsworn cell, then it’s purely a Stormcloak vs Imperial fight.
Phase 1: Breach the Gates or Walls. The Markarth city gate is reinforced Dwemer stone. A frontal ram
might be impractical. If players planted explosives (maybe mining black powder from Dawnstar earlier? If
any), this is a good payoff: blowing the gate open. Otherwise, they might opt for a distraction and climb:
cause commotion at the front (fire arrows, siege noise) while a team scales the less-guarded back wall near
the river. A PC with Climbing or Magic could lead that. This is an overcome (Athletics or Stealth) with the risk
of a fall into rapids if failed. Once atop, they secure a small foothold on the battlements and can drop ropes
for others – essentially opening a way. A conflict breaks out on the walls with Markarth guards (who use
Reach for fighting style, perhaps lighter armor but deadly scimitars).
Markarth’s ballistae (Dwemer built maybe) fire from towers; a PC might prioritize taking those out before
they skewer Stormcloak ranks below. Perhaps one dramatic moment: a ballista bolt nails a Stormcloak
captain to a wall. A PC could try a Craft or Sabotage roll to turn a captured ballista around on the defenders
(tagging “Captured Dwarven Ballista” to rain their own quarrels on them).
Phase 2: Street Fighting in Markarth. Markarth’s layout is terraced. Stormcloaks fight through the market
terrace (where Silver-Blood Inn and shops are). Civilians cower in the Warrens and under bridges.
Emphasize environment: narrow stone streets, lots of cover and verticality (archers on balconies). Possibly
incorporate the Dwemer machinery aspect: pipes that hiss steam, some still-functional automated
defenses (maybe a couple of dormant Dwarven automaton spheres get awakened by stray damage – because
why not have a sudden third-party enemy?). If that happens, those automata attack indiscriminately (both
sides). PCs can choose to turn that to advantage (lure Imperials into a trap with an angry automaton) or
shut them down to protect everyone. A scholarly PC might recall a shut-off lever in Understone Keep’s
museum (leading them to dash there under fire to pull it).
Major Beats:
- Jarl Igmund and Family Evacuating: The young Jarl Igmund (Imperial loyalist) might attempt to flee to
the Keep’s secret exit if defeat seems imminent. If PCs intercept him, they can capture rather than kill him
(Ulfric would likely prefer capturing Jarls to show legitimacy, except Ulfric’s known to execute some – he
executed Torygg earlier in the war). This could be a tense negotiation: Igmund yields if assured his people
won’t be harmed. Or if the PCs have a grudge (maybe Igmund’s father betrayed them in the past), they
might duel him. Keep in mind his replacement if removed is Thongvor Silver-Blood, a Stormcloak supporter.
The Silver-Blood family might even aid the Stormcloaks from within: if a PC made contact with Thongvor or
his brother Thonar, they might betray Igmund mid-battle (e.g., Silver-Blood thugs attack the city guards
from behind at a critical moment, turning the tide). In that case, Markarth falls faster (the Silver-Bloods
essentially stage a coup). This moral complication – working with a ruthless family of crime lords – can be
noted by PCs. Maven Black-Briar and the Silver-Bloods are somewhat parallels in corruption on SC side.
18
- The Cidhna Mine: Markarth’s prison, full of Forsworn captives. During the fight, either due to sabotage or
the PCs’ choice, the mine’s gates might be opened. If Forsworn prisoners pour out, chaos ensues. They’ll
attack Nord soldiers and maybe even Stormcloaks. It might benefit short-term (distracting the city guard),
but long-term it’s another wild card. A PC might run to Cidhna Mine to keep those prisoners locked until
after the battle (especially if they promised a truce with Forsworn – you wouldn’t want newly freed angry
Forsworn in the middle of your victory). Alternatively, freeing them could be used as a tactic if the
Stormcloaks are struggling – turn the prisoners loose as extra fighters. Present this choice if possible.
- Daedric Artifact in Markarth: Markarth houses the Shrine of Talos (where Eltrys in game meets you) and
that abandoned house (Molag Bal’s shrine). If a fight spills into the Talos shrine, perhaps a Stormcloak (with
Talos amulet) gains a Boost “Blessing of Talos” from the sacred aura, inspiring them. Conversely, if they
chase some cultist into the abandoned house, a sudden supernatural event could happen (like the doors
slam and a disembodied voice of Molag Bal taunts them). This might be foreshadowing for Act III if Molag
Bal will have a role (maybe not, but it’s a creepy Easter egg for Elder Scrolls fans). It can simply set tone of
Markarth’s haunted past.
Climax of Siege: Likely, the final holdout is Understone Keep, the palace. The last Imperial defenders (and/
or city guards who remain loyal to Igmund) barricade the huge Dwemer doors. The PCs and Stormcloak
elites must push in. This could be resolved by either a negotiation (maybe an overwhelmed steward opens
the gates to avoid bloodshed in the sacred keep) or by a forceful assault. Understone Keep interior is vast,
with the Dwarven museum and the Jarl’s throne area. A boss fight idea: The Imperials activate a
Dwarven Centurion (giant automaton) as a last ditch defense. The PCs then face this steam-belching giant.
They might have to lure it under a collapsing pillar or hit it with shock magic to disable. While that
rampages, Jarl Igmund either flees or fights from his throne dais with his personal guard. Eventually, the
centurion collapses with a thud, and the Stormcloak banner is raised in the Keep. Markarth falls to Ulfric’s
cause.
Aftermath (Stormcloak success): Ulfric will install Thongvor Silver-Blood as Jarl 25 , unless the PCs did
something radical like insisted on someone else. Thongvor, gruff and satisfied, thanks the PCs: “You’ll never
pay for a drink in Markarth again, mark my words.” However, those more virtuous PCs may note: the Silver-
Bloods are basically crime lords. Markarth’s “liberation” might just hand it from one tyrant to another. This is
great fodder for moral conflict. For instance, if a PC is from Markarth and hates the Silver-Blood oppression,
how do they reconcile helping them to power? That could be compelled for inner turmoil or argument with
Ulfric’s decisions. Ulfric might argue pragmatically: “Thongvor’s support was vital. We all must make
sacrifices.” Fate Point opportunity for the conflicted.
Also, by now, the PCs almost certainly see patterns: Whiterun’s siege was costly, Markarth’s siege too – each
time, there were strange undercurrents (Forsworn, possibly Thalmor hints). Perhaps they discuss among
themselves how every hold has some dark secret or conflict fanning the flames. If one PC has high Lore or a
knack for conspiracy, they might even suspect the Thalmor involvement behind these consistent troubles
(the GM can feed them an intuition). They may not act on it yet, but the idea is planted.
Alternate Outcome (Stormcloaks fail at Markarth): Should the players utterly fail, maybe reinforcements
from High Rock relieve Markarth or the Forsworn disrupt the Stormcloaks fatally. This is unlikely unless by
GM design, as losing two big battles in a row would probably end the rebellion. But one can salvage a
partial failure: e.g., Stormcloaks take Markarth but Ulfric’s beloved second Galmar dies in combat, making it
a pyrrhic victory (affecting morale). Or they fail to get inside initially and have to retreat from the first
19
attempt – meaning Act III might include a second attempt or a shift of strategy. In general, assume their
momentum carries, but calibrate difficulty so wins are earned but not impossible.
Imperial Campaign – “Operation Shadowfang” (Crushing the Rift Rebellion)
Setting the Stage (Imperial context): Meanwhile, on the Imperial side in Act II, General Tullius isn’t idle.
With Whiterun secured for the Empire (assuming that Act I outcome), Tullius decides to press the advantage
into the rebel holds. He plans a major push into The Rift – the southeastern hold containing Riften, long a
Stormcloak-aligned city (Jarl Laila Law-Giver supports Ulfric 26 ). The Rift is strategically important as it
borders Cyrodiil and Morrowind, potentially allowing Ulfric to get outside help or escape routes. Taking
Riften would cut off Stormcloak resource lines (and give the Empire control of that region’s rich resources
like timber and Nightshade). Tullius codenames the plan “Operation Shadowfang” – since the Rift’s terrain
is forested and often shrouded in mist, and perhaps referencing the need to quietly neutralize Riften’s
infamous criminal networks that could bite the Empire from the shadows. The PCs, given their performance
at Whiterun, are key operatives in this plan. Legate Rikke (Tullius’s Nord deputy) will likely coordinate this
offensive, and might personally accompany part of it.
Operation Goals: Seize Fort Greenwall (a fort north of Riften) to stage troops, then assault Riften City.
Additionally, neutralize the Thieves Guild and Black-Briar influence in Riften that might undermine
Imperial authority. Maven Black-Briar, a powerful Riften noble, is actually pro-Empire (she stands to become
Jarl if the Empire wins 27 ), but she’s self-serving. Meanwhile, Riften is home to the Thieves Guild and maybe
a hidden Dark Brotherhood contact – lots of underworld activity. The Empire might actually strike a deal
with Maven to betray the Stormcloak Jarl from within, but they need to ensure the city’s criminal element
doesn’t cause chaos during the attack. The PCs could be tasked with something unique: Make contact with
Maven or infiltrate the Thieves Guild to either secure their cooperation or sabotage them before the siege.
Scene 1 (Imperial): Ambush at Fort Greenwall
Imperial scouts report that Fort Greenwall is held by a strong Stormcloak garrison blocking the road to
Riften. Rikke decides on a two-prong approach: one force will attack the fort’s front as a diversion, while a
second (led by the PCs) sneaks through Shadowgreen Cave (a known nearby cave/tunnel) to emerge inside
or behind the fort. This uses stealth and cunning – an Imperial specialty over Stormcloak brute force. The
goal is to open the gates from inside or cause confusion so the main force can take the fort with minimal
losses.
Cave Infiltration Challenge: The PCs navigate Shadowgreen Cave (or a similar cavern). It’s dark, filled with
bioluminescent fungi – an Aspect “Gloomy Bioluminescence” which can either help (dim light, easier to
hide) or hinder (weird glowing mushrooms that might react to movement). Inside lurk either wild animals or
perhaps a band of Skyrim’s creatures – e.g., a cave bear or a troll. The PCs can choose to eliminate these
quietly or avoid them. A fun bit: maybe the cave connects to Skyrim’s famous Dwemer ruins a bit – like
they find an old Dwemer steam pipe that leads under the fort. They might need to solve a minor puzzle to
open a maintenance grate (Craft or Lore roll to manipulate Dwemer mechanism). If the players fancy a
fight, toss in a Frostbite Spider lair – thematically in a shadowy operation, spiders are apt. Killing them
quickly without noise is key to remain undetected.
They emerge at night behind Fort Greenwall’s walls. Rain begins (Aspect “Pouring Rain and Mud”). They
see Stormcloak sentries on the ramparts, but the main attention is facing the road where Rikke’s frontal
assault is beginning (distant sounds of clamor). The PCs must act fast: either open the fort’s gate or
20
sabotage something. Perhaps they split: one group to the gate winch, another to eliminate the commander.
Set up zones in the fort: courtyard (with barracks and stables), walls, gatehouse, inner keep.
Using stealth, the PCs could knife a few guards (Fate note: you can treat mooks as one-roll minions or
challenges to overcome quietly). If they get spotted too early, an alarm sounds and they’ll have to fight a full
garrison at once – not impossible but tough. Ideally, they time opening the gate as Rikke’s troops charge.
That triggers a big melee where PCs have allies flooding in. They might then duel the Stormcloak fort
commander, a brutish Nord nicknamed “Hulking Harrald” or such, on the battlements. Show his
perspective: he’s been expecting this, and curses the Empire’s trickery when he sees the gate inexplicably
open. Possibly he tries to collapse the tunnel or blow the ammo cache as a last resort; PCs might stop him.
A complication to introduce: The fort’s storeroom has caged wolves (for war) – during battle, those get
loose (perhaps a stray fire sets them free). Now wolves are attacking indiscriminately. This chaos can be
compelled onto someone (maybe a PC with “Fear of Animals” or just as environment causing harm). PCs
could try to calm or corner wolves (Animal Handling type overcome). Or leave them – they might end up
mauling a fleeing Stormcloak, which is both brutal and telling of war’s unpredictability.
Victory at Fort Greenwall is likely. Imperial flag replaces bear flag on fort. Legate Rikke congratulates PCs,
possibly with a grim nod: “This was well executed. We’ll make proper soldiers of you lot yet.” One PC maybe
thinks, “We already are, Legate,” if they’re career soldiers – some banter. They also find useful intel here:
perhaps a letter from Ulfric to Jarl Laila in Riften saying help is on the way, etc. Or a Thalmor dossier (if a
Justiciar was liaising with Stormcloaks here) but that might be too revealing too soon. Maybe not yet.
Instead, maybe an captured Stormcloak mutters “Damn those elves in their embassy… This is all because of
them.” If pressed, he drunkenly rants that the Thalmor wanted this war. Planting seeds.
Side Plot B – “Underbelly of Riften” (Thieves Guild and Black-Briar Intrigue):
Before or during the siege of Riften, the PCs have the chance (or order) to handle Riften’s internal snake pit.
Riften is known for corruption. Maven Black-Briar effectively runs the economy, and the Thieves Guild
operates out of the Ratway undercity. Additionally, the Dark Brotherhood might have a small presence
(perhaps merely hinted at by the mysterious cemetery door of the Nightingale Hall or something – but
that’s more Thieves Guild/Beyond scope). The Thalmor interest here: likely minimal direct, but in a chaotic
siege, thieves could loot everything or cause civilian harm, which again drags things out. Actually, a cunning
Thalmor might have bribed the Thieves Guild to take certain actions (like steal an important artifact or
sabotage the city’s defense from within) to ensure maximum confusion. Alternatively, the Thieves Guild
might just see opportunity. Maven, being pro-Imperial, might attempt to bring Riften to capitulation with
minimal fight – if she can quietly oust Jarl Laila or incapacitate her guards, the city could fall with less blood.
The PCs might be her instruments or her rivals in this.
Approaches: - Diplomacy/Bribery: Tullius instructs the PCs: “Contact Maven Black-Briar; assure her if she
helps us, she will remain in power.” The PCs meet Maven perhaps in secret at The Bee and Barb inn,
upstairs. She’s a shrewd, intimidating woman (Aspect “Riften’s Real Power”). She doesn’t need persuading
to side with the winning team, but she does demand promises: e.g., the Empire will ignore certain…
“businesses” of hers. If the PCs give too much, they risk enabling a tyrant after war. If they press her, she can
threaten to withhold her help (which means a tougher fight for Riften). Ideally they strike a deal: Maven will
ensure the city guard captain (who is on her payroll) orders a stand-down at critical moment, and in return
the PCs vow that Maven will indeed be Jarl and her family privileges protected. Fate-wise, this might give
them an Aspect “Maven’s Secret Support” to invoke during the battle (e.g., one round the city guard
21
doesn’t shoot because of her orders). But later, if they go back on the deal, Maven will become an enemy.
- Thieves Guild infiltration: The PCs (particularly a stealthy or criminal-background one) might choose to
talk to or neutralize the Thieves Guild. Maybe Brynjolf or Vex from the Guild greet them in the Ragged
Flagon: “Well, if it isn’t the mighty heroes. We’ve no quarrel with you lot. We just want to make some coin
out of this mess.” The guild might actually be convinced to cooperate for a price – e.g., ensure minimal
harm to civilians or not sabotage the gates. Or the PCs could sabotage the guild themselves – e.g., flood the
Ratway (perhaps break the cistern gates, causing water to rush in). That might incapacitate some thieves
temporarily. Or they arrest the guild leader (though that’s hard; these are slippery folk).
- Dark Brotherhood cameo: If any PC is of the Brotherhood or they have interacted before, Riften’s
graveyard could host a hooded “friend”. Possibly the Brotherhood was hired to kill either Maven (by
Stormcloak sympathizers who hate her) or Jarl Laila (by Maven herself or Thalmor stirring pot). The PCs
might stumble upon an assassination attempt mid-siege: an assassin aims for Laila Law-Giver as the walls
are breached. Do they let it happen (makes conquest easier but a dishonorable murder)? Or stop it? This
can be a brief but dramatic scene. If a PC is pro-DB, they might even be the assassin’s ally or competitor.
Main idea: By addressing these underworld elements, the PCs can reduce Riften’s resistance or collateral
damage. If they succeed, when the main battle comes, perhaps the city yields faster – e.g., half the city
guard simply doesn’t fight (Maven’s influence), making the PC’s job easier. If they fail or ignore it, Riften’s
defense is stiff and chaotic: thieves might take up arms against everyone (imagine them looting during fire,
or the guild setting parts of city on fire to cover escapes). That could ironically hamper the Imperials (fire
spreads beyond control).
Scene 2 (Imperial): The Battle for Riften – Lions at the Gate
Now the culmination: With Fort Greenwall taken, Imperial forces march on Riften. Riften sits on Lake
Honrich, with high walls. The Imperial plan likely involves an frontal assault on the main gate (guarded by a
drawbridge over the canal) while possibly a small force swims the lake to come from the docks side. PCs
could choose either approach.
Phase 1: Storming the Gate. If Maven/guard collusion is in play, maybe the drawbridge is lowered at an
opportune time, suspiciously easily. If not, PCs might have to lower it under fire (climb the wall or find the
mechanism via the canal). Perhaps they sneak a couple of soldiers via sewer to pop up and open the gates.
A famous TES reference: Maul, Maven’s thug, could double-cross someone – maybe he was paid by Ulfric to
actually lock the gates and hold Maven hostage if she tried betrayal. The PCs might catch him at the winch
trying to keep it shut. A quick fight with Maul (Aspect “Thug with a Vengeance”) and they toss him off the
rampart, and then the gates open.
Phase 2: City fight. Riften’s narrower than Whiterun/Markarth, mostly a big plaza (the market) and
surrounding lanes. The central market becomes a battlefield. The unique environment here: canal
boardwalks and a honeycomb of wooden houses (risk of fire). The Temple of Mara’s bells ring in alarm.
Stormcloak archers on rooftops, maybe the Riften Fishery workers joining to fight off invaders with fishing
spears (loyal to their Jarl). The Imperials push in phalanx style. The PCs probably carve a path to Mistveil
Keep (Jarl’s palace at city’s end).
Notable NPCs in battle:
- Jarl Laila Law-Giver – A decent but not extraordinary leader. She might rally a last stand at the Keep, or if
Maven’s coup happens, she might be found wounded or locked up before PCs even arrive (Maven’s doing).
The PCs then deal with Maven or her personal mercenaries inside (Maven might try to claim credit: “I’ve
22
saved you the trouble; Riften is yours. Now honor our arrangement.”).
- Maven’s son, Hemming Black-Briar might lead some house guards either to help Imperials or if upset by
invasion, even fight them (if they double-cross Maven).
- The Thieves Guild mostly stays hidden. But one thief named Brynjolf might take this chance to pickpocket a
PC mid-fight for fun – up to you for a light moment (“really, during a war?!”).
Side encounter: The Ratway. At some point a fire or collapse might open a hole into the Ratway.
Perhaps fleeing Stormcloaks hide there. PCs could pursue in the dark tunnels and find themselves
ambushed by desperate stragglers or thieves. It’s a moody aside – torchlit brick corridors, dripping
water. They might also discover evidence of a Skooma lab** (indicating Riften’s drug trade). They could
destroy it (which scores points with law-abiding citizens but maybe annoys Maven who profits from it if
allied).
Climax at Mistveil Keep: The final confrontation occurs in the Jarl’s throne room. If Laila is present with her
housecarl and a few staunch Stormcloaks, she’ll refuse to surrender until pressed. Possibly Legate Rikke
joins the PCs here to accept her surrender or fight. If Maven orchestrated things, maybe the PCs arrive to
find Laila already deposed and Maven sitting coolly on the throne with a Black-Briar banner. That’s eerie for
them: they essentially traded an overt Stormcloak for a subtle tyrant. Possibly Rikke disapproves but
pragmatically accepts.
Outcome (Imperial victory): Riften falls, the Imperial Dragon banner raised over Mistveil Keep. Jarl Laila (if
alive) is exiled or imprisoned. Maven Black-Briar is installed as Jarl (she will indeed in canon if Imperials
take Riften 26 ). There’s no joyous celebration from citizens – Riften’s folk are sullen and fearful (they traded
one set of masters for another perhaps). PCs might feel that moral gray. However, strategically it’s a big win:
the Empire now controls the south-east.
Legate Rikke thanks them, maybe a bit somberly: “We did what we had to. The Rift is ours. Talos guide those
who fell today.” She might quietly caution a PC she trusts: “Keep an eye on Maven. The Empire may need
her, but I fear what Skyrim will become under such people.” Hinting that victory could be hollow if it
empowers corrupt figures – reflecting the theme of costs of war.
Alternate outcome (Imperial fail at Riften): If Stormclaw reinforcements arrived or the PCs didn’t
neutralize the guild and got overwhelmed, maybe the Imperials have to retreat from a botched first assault.
They could try again later or shift to another target (like attempt Winterhold or something). But likely with
PC heroics, Riften will fall to them. If something like Maven betraying them happened, that could cause
fiasco: e.g., Maven double-crosses and at last moment swings city guard back to Stormcloak side, surprising
the Imperials and repelling them. That’s dramatic but maybe too early for such a twist; maybe save double-
cross for later story if at all.
Act II Resolution:
By the end of Act II, each faction’s campaign likely succeeded in capturing key cities: Stormcloaks took
Markarth (and perhaps Falkreath or others in interim), Imperials took Riften (and likely Dawnstar or
Winterhold next, which could be off-screen or quick missions if needed). The map of Skyrim is now heavily
in each side’s favor in different regions. Only the final strongholds remain: Solitude for the Empire,
Windhelm for the Stormcloaks – setting the stage for Act III/IV ultimate confrontations. But more
importantly, through Act II’s side plots, the PCs have encountered multiple instances of covert interference:
Forsworn chaos, Daedric cults, criminal factions – all seemingly independent but each conveniently fueling
23
disorder. Patterns start emerging. The Thalmor presence hasn’t been loudly revealed, but keen players
should suspect their influence after reading documents or hearing rumors at least 12 .
Allow a breather scene after the dust settles. Perhaps a war council meeting for each side to plan the next
act, where PCs can voice concerns. For Stormcloaks: Ulfric might be buoyant after Markarth, planning to
move on Solitude. For Imperials: Tullius, proud of Riften’s fall, eyes Windhelm next. Both sides likely
consider Winterhold or Dawnstar minor mop-ups if not done (they might delegate those to secondary
forces or quick treaties – e.g., Winterhold’s pro-Stormcloak Jarl could capitulate if isolated).
Crucially, seed Act III by having NPCs bring news of strange occurrences: maybe reports from Dawnstar of
mass nightmares (Vaermina’s doing), or Winterhold of magical anomalies near the College, or Falkreath of
a plague of undeath (vampire or undead stirring, maybe due to the war causing neglected graves). These
are hooks for Act III’s more supernatural/dark elements. They underscore that the war is unleashing or
coinciding with other evils – which a perceptive character might link to “someone taking advantage of the
chaos.” Indeed, the Thalmor or even Daedric Princes are exploiting Skyrim’s turmoil.
Transition to Act III will involve tackling some of these internal crises, character development (especially for
Hadvar and Ralof), and possibly a temporary lull in direct military campaigns (maybe a truce or stalemate
occurs as both sides lick wounds), giving room for more investigative and character-driven stories. Little do
the factions know, the Thalmor’s grand scheme is inching toward fruition in the background, ready to be
unveiled in Act IV. The players’ actions in Act II—whom they allied with, what compromises they accepted—
will have ripple effects felt in the next acts, both narratively and via aspects (e.g., “Maven’s Pocket Empire”
in Riften or “Forsworn Resurgence” in the Reach could be aspects to invoke/compel later).
With Act II done, the stage is set: Skyrim is bloodied and weary, victories have been won but at moral costs,
and ominous shadows loom behind the scenes. Act III will delve into those shadows, pushing the PCs to
confront the heart of darkness within their own factions and the land itself, before the final confrontation
with the puppet-masters fueling this war.
