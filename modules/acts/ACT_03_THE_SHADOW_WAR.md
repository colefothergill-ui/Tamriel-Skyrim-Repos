Act III: The Shadow War – Subterfuge and Sorcery Amid Conflict
Summary: Act III shifts focus from open battlefronts to the hidden and psychological dimensions of the
war. With each side holding significant territory, the civil war enters a phase of attrition, espionage, and
internal strife. This Act is about the “war in the shadows” – uncovering Thalmor plots, dealing with Daedric
meddling directly, and resolving personal vendettas. The PCs will likely undertake missions that involve
infiltration, investigation, and confronting creeping darkness within Skyrim’s society and even within
themselves. Major NPC arcs move toward resolution here: Hadvar and Ralof each face intense personal
tests that reflect the war’s toll on identity and loyalty. Act III’s climax might not be a grand battle, but rather
a turning point revelation – the discovery of the Thalmor’s grand interference (or at least undeniable
proof of it) and perhaps a moment where PCs can influence their leaders’ recognition of the true enemy.
The end of Act III likely sees the war approaching its final act – with possibly a pause or uneasy truce as
both sides grapple with revelations, setting the stage for Act IV’s endgame.
By now, thematic stakes are high: players should feel the weight of patriotism vs. conscience, see Nords
on both sides questioning themselves, and sense tragedy in every victory. This Act is structured around key
24
events in a few cities and locations: Dawnstar’s nightmare curse, Winterhold’s magical crisis, a possible
peace negotiation at High Hrothgar (optional but a classic scenario reminiscent of Skyrim’s “Season
Unending” conference quest), and the personal side-stories culminating for Ralof and Hadvar. Branching
paths are significant here: players might push for a temporary ceasefire to deal with a greater threat (e.g. a
Daedric monster or a Thalmor assassin targeting both sides’ leaders), or they might double-down on
partisanship until the Thalmor’s hand forces an unlikely cooperation. GM should be flexible – Act III could
even allow a scenario where, say, Stormcloak and Imperial PC groups (if the party was split by perspective
earlier) finally intersect and could choose to either clash or collaborate against a revealed third-party
threat.
We’ll break Act III into several scenario segments:
Scene 1: The Dreams of the Pale (Dawnstar’s Nightmare)
In the northern coastal town of Dawnstar (the Pale’s capital), an uncanny affliction strikes: everyone is
plagued by unending nightmares, leaving the garrison and civilians exhausted and paranoid 28 . This is
the setup of the Skyrim quest “Waking Nightmare” (Vaermina’s artifact, the Skull of Corruption). In our
campaign, whichever faction holds Dawnstar now (initially Stormcloaks under Jarl Skald, but it could have
switched to Imperials under Brina Merilis if Imperials took the Pale in Act II) – the problem affects all
equally, an opportunity for a side ceasefire. For instance, if Imperials control Dawnstar, Jarl Brina (an ex-
Legionnaire, pragmatic) might ask Stormcloak prisoners or contacts for help if they have a clue; or vice versa,
Stormcloak Jarl Skald might grudgingly welcome any help including from an Imperial envoy because he
sees it as a curse likely sent by elves or something. The PCs, if nearby or notified, are asked to investigate as
this could be either a Thalmor trick or a genuine Daedric curse threatening to sideline an entire hold’s
contribution to the war.
Investigation: Arriving in Dawnstar, the PCs find a bleak scene. Men with red-rimmed eyes wander like
living ghosts. Miners too scared to enter the mines (they “saw things” in the dark). The local priest of Mara,
Erandur (if using game NPC, a reformed Vaermina cultist) seeks help to end this curse 29 30 . He explains
it’s Vaermina’s doing – a Daedric Prince of nightmares. The source is the Nightcaller Temple on the hill,
an old abandoned monastery where Vaermina’s Skull of Corruption artifact resides, polluting dreams. He’s
tried to form a small band to go dispel it, but needs protection. The PCs likely accept (both out of heroism
and pragmatic need: a whole hold’s soldiers ineffective = weakness to enemy). This can be a classic
dungeon crawl horror scene.
Nightcaller Temple Dungeon: Inside the temple, which is an old fort, they face magical traps causing
hallucinations (Aspects like “Phantasmal Terror” causing Will saves or mental stress), cultist remnants or
manifestations (maybe dream-induced specters of past Orc invaders that fought here in lore). The goal is to
reach the inner sanctum and destroy or seal the Skull. Use Fate challenges: e.g., a mental conflict where
each PC experiences their worst fear as an illusion. You can personalize: maybe Hadvar sees Helgen’s
dragon fire again, immobilizing him until a PC snaps him out; Ralof might see Imperial torturers; a PC mage
might see themselves losing control of magic etc. They overcome by clever roleplay or resisting with Will. At
the climax, maybe a mini-boss: A Vaermina Devotee (possibly the entity of a former priest possessed by
the Skull’s power) fights them, using mind-control attempts (could temporarily turn a PC against others – a
compel on an Aspect like “Susceptible to mind tricks” if any, or just a temporary Aspect “Dominated by
Nightmares” on a PC to overcome to act freely). Eventually, Erandur and PCs perform a ritual to nullify the
Skull – or if PCs are greedy, they might be tempted to take the Skull artifact (dangerous, as it allows
25
siphoning dreams at cost of corruption). The likely righteous path is destroying it, freeing Dawnstar from
the curse 31 . Dawnstar’s people immediately start to sleep better; morale restored. The Jarl (Skald or Brina)
thanks them.
Impact: If Stormcloak and Imperial players/groups are separate, this quest is a great neutral ground to
have them cooperate briefly. Maybe Tullius and Ulfric agreed that Dawnstar’s nightmare needed solving
and allowed a joint task force (the PCs from each side). After working together in a dark dungeon, even
bitter enemies might gain respect. Use this to build Ralof and Hadvar’s personal camaraderie if possible –
maybe they were uneasy allies here and saved each other’s lives from a terror demon. That can deepen
their arcs (especially if in Act IV they need to possibly broker peace). Reward the party with a boon: perhaps
a rare alchemical ingredient from Vaermina’s realm that Erandur gives (mechanically could allow a one-
time create advantage “Dreamstride Vision” to be used later for insight). Also, a Fate Point refresh could
narratively occur after this cathartic win.
Importantly, in investigating the temple’s history or Erandur’s notes, the PCs find references that the
Vaermina cult initially grew strong because the Orc chieftain of the Great War (a historical event) had
collaborated to attack Dawnstar, implying external influences sowing nightmares to weaken the hold even
back then. This parallels current events – a subtle sign that someone always tries to weaken Skyrim
through its own fears. Hmm.
Scene 2: The High King’s Ghost (Windhelm’s Racial Tensions and “Blood on the Ice”)
Switching to Eastmarch and Windhelm, especially if Imperials are about to attack it or if Stormcloaks still
hold it but are troubled internally. Windhelm’s known issue: the serial killer (“Blood on the Ice” quest in
game) targeting young women in the city, and the simmering racism towards Dunmer in the Grey Quarter.
If Imperials hold most of Skyrim except Windhelm, maybe some in Windhelm think of surrender; if
Stormcloaks still hold, maybe morale is shaky hearing of Ulfric’s conquests stalled or reversed. In either
case, a specter from the past arises: a murderer known as the Butcher strikes in Windhelm’s streets, killing
locals (likely Nords but in game it was young women, possibly of various races). The twist: The murderer is
Calixto (an old man with a necromantic obsession, in game), trying to reassemble his dead sister’s body.
But I propose adding a thematic angle: he is also spurred by the unrest – maybe he explicitly targets those
who “consort with the enemy” (if Stormcloak, he kills a Nord girl seen talking to an Imperial; if Imperial, he
kills someone collaborating with occupying forces). So his insanity gets a political tinge.
The PCs could be drawn in if in Windhelm (either because they are there for talks, or infiltrating, or
stationed). For Stormcloak PCs, Ulfric might quietly ask them to solve it because it’s scaring citizens (and he
doesn’t want to seem incapable). For Imperial PCs if they just captured Windhelm in Act IV, maybe this
occurs during occupation – a killer undermining their ‘liberation’ by causing chaos, perhaps a Thalmor
leftover? So either timeline it fits: presumably Act III likely before final battle at Windhelm, when tension is
high.
Investigation: They examine crime scenes (using Investigation skill). Clues: strange amulets, butcher’s
journals referencing “the power of King’s flesh” – maybe he imagines resurrecting High King Torygg (weird
twist: what if he’s trying to assemble the dead High King that Ulfric killed, thinking to create a ghostly
claimant to scare Ulfric? That’s one way to incorporate “High King’s ghost”). This is optional but adds mythic
feel: some citizens claim to see Torygg’s ghost wandering the city at night, moaning. It could just be Calixto
26
in a cloak with an illusion. Or perhaps Vaermina’s leftover magic causing apparitions from trauma (Ulfric’s
shout death of Torygg left a spiritual scar?). PCs must decipher reality.
Confrontation: They likely corner Calixto in the Candlehearth Hall or in his House of Curiosities. If Hadvar is
around (Imperial), he might be especially invested – one victim could be someone he knew from childhood
(maybe a cousin in Windhelm). If Ralof is present (Stormcloak), maybe he’s frustrated that Windhelm,
supposed safe capital, is as dangerous as warfront. They capture or kill Calixto. On him they find something
interesting: a Butcher’s journal detailing how he acquired a necromantic tome from a “hooded Altmer”
weeks ago that taught him life-extending rituals. Aha – possibly a Thalmor agent manipulated him (Thalmor
loves sowing fear in Windhelm to weaken Ulfric’s base). This is a direct piece of evidence of Thalmor
interference. It names no names, but description matches a known Thalmor emissary (perhaps one they
met earlier, like that Justiciar in Markarth or Elenwen’s subordinate). PCs get this clue.
Also, this scenario addresses Windhelm’s prejudice: maybe during investigation a Dunmer woman is falsely
accused (similar to game, where they suspect Wuunferth the court mage). PCs can choose to defend the
innocent. If Ralof’s around, this could be pivotal for him – seeing a Dunmer treated unjustly in “his” city
might stir empathy or conflict with his worldview. It plays into his arc (possibly realizing what Ulfric ignored).
In the end, solving the murders calms Windhelm’s populace somewhat, and if Stormcloak side, Ulfric
publicly thanks them (or privately acknowledges it). Perhaps he reassigns some guards to better protect the
Grey Quarter now (inspired by PC’s insistence). It’s minor but meaningful change. If Imperial side (taking
city) and they solve it, it helps win trust of Windhelm citizens a bit (the invaders stopped a killer where
Ulfric’s regime didn’t). That could reflect hearts-and-minds aspect.
Scene 3: Council of Heroes (The High Hrothgar Truce Negotiation) – Optional Heavy
Roleplay Scene
This scene is a homage to the “Season Unending” peace council in Skyrim’s main quest 32 33 , which might
occur if the war stalemates or the PCs push for it upon realizing the Thalmor threat. It is Act III’s dramatic
centerpiece for politics and character confrontation.
Setup: The idea can arise that the civil war is exhausting both sides with Alduin gone, maybe some voices
(like Arngeir of the Greybeards, or General Rikke if Imperial, or Jarl Elisif if Stormcloak side is winning and
she’s captive, etc.) call for a temporary ceasefire to discuss terms or at least prisoner exchange. Perhaps
more pressingly, news of a possible Thalmor incursion or conspiracy freaks out someone in power enough
to agree to talk. For example, after seeing enough evidence (like Butcher’s journal, Forsworn indirect aid,
Dawnstar nightmares clearly magical interference), General Tullius and Ulfric Stormcloak could be
convinced (by the PCs or their advisors) to send envoys to a neutral parley – likely at High Hrothgar, home
of the Greybeards, who in lore brokered the ceasefire once 32 . The Greybeards (or just Arngeir) invite the
leaders under the ancient rule of peace on sacred ground. The PCs might accompany their respective leader
as part of the delegation (indeed, they may be recognized as instrumental heroes whose words carry
weight).
Council Dynamics: Present are Ulfric and Galmar (Stormcloak), Tullius and Rikke (Imperial), possibly Elisif
(to speak for Solitude if Tullius insists) and perhaps an advisor like Elenwen the Thalmor ambassador tries to
attend (in the game she does, which was controversial). Actually, yes, having a Thalmor representative
Elenwen present will really spark drama – and give the PCs a chance to expose or confront her. Arngeir
27
moderates, expecting civil discussion. But bitterness runs high: Ulfric might immediately taunt Elisif about
her slain husband, Tullius might call Ulfric a murderer, etc. The system can be run as a social conflict or
contest, where each side has “demands” to trade. In the game, they traded holds to balance. Here, maybe
things like: Ulfric wants Empire to withdraw from the Reach and Markarth; Tullius wants Ulfric to cease Talos
rhetoric in exchange for a ceasefire, etc. The PCs can intervene to sway arguments with Diplomacy,
Intimidation (a loud Thu’um shout to silence bickering maybe, if a PC has Voice powers).
Key moment – Thalmor Reveal: During talks, one agenda item: evidence of Thalmor interference. The PCs
(assuming they have collected proof pieces) can lay them out on the negotiation table. For example: “We
have here a dossier from a Thalmor operative that none of you have seen – it calls Ulfric an ‘uncooperative
asset’ and explicitly says the Thalmor benefit from this war 34 15 .” That is explosive. Ulfric, furious, denies
being anyone’s asset – but the evidence is strong (maybe signed by Elenwen). Tullius is grim as he reads it –
he mutters that his suspicions were right. If Elenwen is present, she’ll try to dismiss it as forgery, but her
facade cracks (maybe sweat). A PC with Insight can call out her lie. If cornered, she might lash verbally: “It’s
true. We did everything short of gutting your leaders ourselves to keep this conflict alive – and you fools
played into our hands!” Possibly she reveals too much if villainously monologuing – and tries to storm out
or call backup. Ulfric might roar in rage and attempt to physically attack Elenwen then and there. This could
escalate: if Elenwen had hidden guards outside, a brief skirmish could break out (the truce nearly
collapsing). PCs must decide – do they protect Elenwen from Ulfric’s wrath to maintain peace, or let him kill
her? If Elenwen is killed here by Ulfric or someone, that’s one Thalmor down but maybe not strategically
best – she could be more useful as a prisoner. Arngeir would be dismayed at bloodshed in High Hrothgar.
Nevertheless, this reveal should unify (at least partially) the humans against the Thalmor threat. The
ultimate theme: Maybe Nords and Imperials have more in common than they thought – a common
enemy. This doesn’t end the war automatically, but it definitely causes pause. Perhaps a temporary
armistice is agreed: e.g., a 30-day ceasefire to deal with “certain revelations.” Ulfric might not shake Tullius’s
hand, but he nods curtly, “When we resume, General, it will be with all this in light. But for now... the
Dominion has much to answer for.” Tullius begrudgingly respects Ulfric’s willingness to pause for greater
good (or sees it as chance to rearm – up to interpretation). The Greybeards praise this “first step toward true
peace,” though PCs might know true peace is far off.
Personal arc notes in council:
- Hadvar likely stands by Tullius, glaring at Ulfric (who nearly had him executed at Helgen). But after hearing
Thalmor stuff, he might swallow pride and say something like, “Sir, perhaps... this fight can wait until the
Dominion’s dealt with.” This shows his maturity – big growth from just a loyal soldier to someone who sees
bigger picture (Talos worshiper in him quietly cheering to fight Thalmor directly).
- Ralof stands by Ulfric and might call Hadvar a bootlicker at first. But when evidence of Thalmor comes, he
looks shocked, remembering Helgen too (he saw Elenwen there). He perhaps publicly apologizes to Ulfric
for doubting, but privately to a PC later admits, “I hated the Empire so much I never dreamed the real
enemy stood right beside them.” If Elenwen is still present, Ralof likely spits at her feet, uttering a curse
about avenging all murdered by Thalmor.
Thus Act III could end either with that fragile truce or at least all sides aware of Thalmor treachery. If you
choose not to have a peace council, you can still have the evidence reveal happen via other means (like PCs
sneaking into Thalmor embassy themselves and catching evidence, culminating in a boss fight in Act IV
perhaps). But the council is a nice chance for roleplay and final venting of grievances before final battles.
28
Regardless, by Act III’s end, the Thalmor’s covert role is definitively exposed to the PCs and likely to
leaders. The true antagonist stands revealed: the Thalmor orchestrated much of this tragedy 21 . Now Act
IV can focus on confronting the ramifications – either the war resumes with more ferocity (but perhaps
clarity), or maybe a brief alliance of convenience happens (e.g., both sides allow the PCs to launch a joint
strike on a Thalmor target).
Additionally, by Act III end, Hadvar and Ralof’s personal arcs hit their climax: perhaps Ralof sees Ulfric
not as infallible (maybe he’s troubled Ulfric was inadvertently used by Thalmor), and Hadvar sees the
Empire’s failings (the Concordat enabling this situation). Each considers what Skyrim truly needs. They
might voice these doubts to the PCs, each considering perhaps that victory at all costs isn’t as sweet if the
Thalmor still rule from shadows. This primes possible endings where these NPCs could make surprising
choices (like Ralof maybe prevents Ulfric from executing Elisif, or Hadvar refuses an order to kill a
surrendering Stormcloak – those could be Act IV moments).
Give the players and their characters a moment in quiet after the council or revelations: perhaps at night on
the 7,000 steps, a PC contemplates the sky, now free of Alduin but filled with uncertainty. A perhaps
unexpected cameo: the Dragonborn themselves passes by on their way down from speaking with
Greybeards (if timeline fits) – they nod to the PCs and offer a word: “The gods gave you all a hard path. But I
have faith you’ll make the right choices for Skyrim.” This subtle blessing (call it a Dragonborn’s Blessing
aspect for final battle use) can be a neat cameo that doesn’t overshadow. Or the Dragonborn sends a gift
via Arngeir: perhaps a Horn of Calling that PC can blow once for aid (maybe summoning a dragon ally
exactly once in final battle or giving a +4 one-time).
Now the stage is set for Act IV: final battles with clearer villainy. The war might still need concluding (Ulfric
vs. Tullius, Windhelm vs. Solitude), but now the Thalmor will likely intervene directly, perhaps making a last
move to kill Ulfric or seize Skyrim’s power in the chaos. The PCs will be at the crux, deciding the war’s
outcome and dealing with the Thalmor’s endgame plan. Themes of identity and unity reach peak: will the
Nords and Empire remain divided or stand together at the eleventh hour? Act IV will answer that, shaped
strongly by all these prior acts’ choices.
