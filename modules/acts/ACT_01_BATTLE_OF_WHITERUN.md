# Act 01 Battle Of Whiterun

Act I: After Alduin – The Battle of Whiterun
Summary: Act I launches the players into action immediately following the defeat of the World-Eater,
Alduin. In a vivid opening scene, the sky clears over Skyrim’s tallest peak, and news spreads that the dragon
crisis is over. But any relief is short-lived – without the dragon threat to unite them, the Stormcloak vs.
Imperial conflict erupts anew. The centerpiece of Act I is the Battle of Whiterun, a decisive early clash in
which Whiterun hold’s neutrality is shattered and both factions commit fully to war 16 . The PCs will pick a
side (or find themselves in the crossfire) as Whiterun is besieged. By Act I’s end, Whiterun will either fall to
Stormcloak liberators or remain firmly in Imperial hands, setting the stage for the rest of the campaign.
Scene 1: Epilogue at the Throat of the World
Setting: High Hrothgar, on the slopes of the Throat of the World. The sun rises over a battered Skyrim. In
the distance, Alduin the World-Eater has been vanquished by the Dragonborn atop the mountain – a
monumental event the PCs may only witness in legend or from afar.
Narrative: The air is charged with ancient magic as Alduin’s death-throes echo like thunder. Perhaps the
PCs came to High Hrothgar seeking refuge or answers after rumors of dragons. If a PC is a member of the
College of Winterhold or similarly learned, they sense a great disturbance in the flow of magicka – as if a
dark shadow has lifted. If a PC is Nordic or a Companion, they recognize the echoing thu’um shout of the
Dragonborn’s victory as the voice of a hero in Sovngarde’s song.

Allow each player to describe what their character was doing in these final moments of the dragon crisis.
Are they injured survivors of a dragon attack who staggered up the 7,000 Steps? Did they aid villagers
fleeing a dragon’s wrath en route? This is a chance to tie the characters to recent world events.
GM Note: You can create a quick Aspect for the environment here, such as “Skies Cleansed by Alduin’s
End”. Any PC can invoke this for comfort or inspiration in the coming scenes (e.g. a +2 when rallying others
with hope: “Take heart, the World-Eater is dead!”). Conversely, you might compel it to remind them that the
Dragonborn’s absence now leaves mortals to face their own conflicts (triggering unease or urgency). This
helps transition from the mythic threat of dragons to the gritty reality of civil war.
After a brief calm, a messenger (perhaps a loyal Courier Aspect “Wide-Eyed and Out of Breath”) arrives at
High Hrothgar or wherever the PCs are catching their breath. He brings news that Ulfric Stormcloak is
marching on Whiterun. Jarl Balgruuf, erstwhile neutral, has declared for the Empire 17 , refusing Ulfric’s
ultimatum, and now Whiterun city is poised to become the war’s first battlefield. The Civil War has
reignited overnight. The messenger implores any able warriors or mages to hurry to Whiterun’s aid – or, if
the PCs have Stormcloak leanings, perhaps they receive a separate call to arms from a Stormcloak scout: “All
true sons and daughters of Skyrim, rally to Windhelm – the hour to take Whiterun is nigh!”
This sets the stage: the PCs know Whiterun will be attacked imminently. They have a personal decision –
which side to support, or whether to get involved at all.
• If PCs are Stormcloak-aligned: They likely heed Ulfric’s call and travel toward the Stormcloak camp
near Whiterun to join the assault force.
• If Imperial-aligned: They rush to Whiterun’s defense, possibly joining Legate Quentin Cipius and
Irileth in shoring up the city’s walls.
• If Neutral/Other Faction: Consider their motivations. A Companion PC at Jorrvaskr in Whiterun will
naturally defend their home city (even if the Companions as an organization try to stay neutral,
individual Companions will fight to protect Whiterun’s people). A College of Winterhold mage might
go to observe or test their magic in a real battle. A Dark Brotherhood assassin could be traveling
incognito, only to find a potential high-value target in the chaos. Encourage neutral PCs to involve
themselves – perhaps a personal friend (NPC) in Whiterun begs for help evacuating their family, or
their faction gives them a task (the College might want an artifact secured from Dragonsreach
before it’s sacked, for example).
Transition the scene by describing the journey to Whiterun. Snow gives way to the tundra plains. As the PCs
approach, they see Whiterun on its hill, the fortress of Dragonsreach silhouetted against a stormy sky.
Camps of soldiers (tents bearing either the red dragon banner of the Empire or the bear of Windhelm) dot
the plains. Tension is in the air. The battle will commence at any moment.
Scene 2: War Councils and Choices in Whiterun
Before swords clash, give the PCs a chance to participate in their faction’s war council. This frames their
involvement and lets them make strategy suggestions (which can affect the battle’s mechanics). Choose the
appropriate sub-scene based on faction:
Stormcloak War Council (Stormcloak PCs):
At the Stormcloak camp at Whiterun’s western approach, Ulfric Stormcloak and his field commander
5
Galmar Stone-Fist stand over a map on a crate, lit by torchlight. Ralof (if he survived Helgen and is affiliated
with the PC, he’s here as a Stormcloak soldier) gives the PCs a hearty welcome – he’s relieved to have
capable friends on this dangerous day. Ulfric’s voice booms: “Whiterun’s Walls are high, but our cause is
higher! Balgruuf’s refusal of my offer means he has sided with the enemy.” He nods to the PCs,
acknowledging any who escaped Helgen: “You know firsthand the Empire’s disregard for Nord lives.” (Ulfric
might be playing to the crowd here – consider giving Ulfric an Aspect “Charismatic Rebel Jarl” that he’s
using to sway his troops.)
Galmar lays out the plan gruffly: storm the city gates with a battering ram, while another team uses ladders
near the stables. They expect heavy resistance from Whiterun’s guards and Imperial reinforcements inside.
Here, let the PCs offer ideas or volunteer for key tasks. For instance, a PC might suggest a flanking move
through the undercroft tunnel beneath the city (invent one if needed, perhaps using a Fate Point to
declare a story detail). If so, Galmar can assign them a small squad to infiltrate that way – this can become a
distinct challenge during the battle (avoiding torch patrols in the tunnel, etc.). Another PC might propose
using a captured catapult to bombard the gates first, creating an advantage. Ulfric is open to bold plans if
they promise fewer Stormcloak deaths.
Use this as a Challenge scene with social skills: perhaps a Command + Strategy challenge. Each overcome
action by PCs to plan or inspire could create Boosts or situation Aspects for the upcoming battle. For
example, if a PC with Tactics or high Lore rolls well to assess the city’s weak points, create an Aspect “Gates
Weak from the Last Raid” (with a free invoke for the battering ram team). If a persuasive PC rallies the
soldiers with a speech invoking Talos (“We fight for the god that the Empire denied us!”), they might place
“Zealous Morale” on the Stormcloak side. Conversely, a failed roll could impose a setback – perhaps
Galmar disagrees and an Aspect “Ulfric’s Doubt” hangs in the air, meaning the PC’s plan won’t have full
support (the GM can invoke that to complicate their plan).
Ralof is present as an ally who chimes in: “Brothers, sisters, I know many of the Companions in Whiterun.
They won’t take kindly to us storming their city… but they might stay out of the fight if we’re careful.” This
foreshadows that not everyone in Whiterun is a faceless enemy; some are Nord companions they respect. A
Stormcloak PC might choose to later find the Companions and convince them to stay neutral – a possible
flashy social encounter mid-battle instead of combat, if desired.
Finally, Ulfric raises his fist: “For Skyrim!” The war chant goes up. Stormcloak PCs gain 1 Fate Point each if
they wholeheartedly join the cause here (a compel on any appropriate aspect like “Stormcloak Loyalist” –
rewarding them for binding themselves to Ulfric’s orders). Now, the siege begins! Proceed to Scene 3,
Stormcloak assault.
Imperial Command Briefing (Imperial PCs):
Inside Dragonsreach, the great hall of Whiterun, Jarl Balgruuf the Greater has reluctantly allowed
Imperial Captain Legate Quentin Cipius and a contingent of Legionnaires to take charge of defense 16 .
The atmosphere is tense; Balgruuf paces, troubled by turning his city into a battlefield, while Irileth (his
Dunmer housecarl) sharpens her blade, ready to defend her Jarl. Hadvar (if he survived Helgen and is
known to the PCs, he’s here, freshly assigned after helgen’s escape) greets the PCs warmly if they’re his
comrades: “Glad you made it – we’ll need every sword. It’s worse than we feared: Ulfric’s got siege engines
out there.” Hadvar’s presence can humanize the Legion for any Nord PCs on the Imperial side – he’s a Nord
fighting for the Empire, just like them, proving not all Imperial soldiers are foreigners.
6
General Tullius is absent (he’s coordinating reinforcements from Solitude), so the defense falls to Legate
Cipius and Balgruuf. Cipius spreads a map on Balgruuf’s war-table (a map of Skyrim marked with colored
flags 18 ). He barks orders: archers on the battlements, barricades at the main gate, and oil cauldrons atop
the walls. Give the PCs a chance to speak up with their own defense plans or volunteer for crucial positions.
For instance, a PC might suggest evacuating civilians to the Temple of Kynareth cellars (preventing collateral
casualties – a Good idea that Balgruuf appreciates, possibly granting a temporary Aspect “City Folk
Sheltered” which means fewer distractions during combat). Another PC might say, “What of the
Companions in Jorrvaskr? Can they aid us?” Balgruuf could note the Companions will defend the city but will
not take official orders – they’ll just protect their mead hall and the local people. This is a hook to involve a
Companion PC or an opportunity for a PC to rally them (if a PC is a Companion, this is their time to lead
their shield-siblings in defense).
If the PCs have magical ability or siege engineering knowledge, Cipius listens grudgingly. An engineering-
inclined PC might rig a “Collapsing Street Trap” (sandbags or rubble to unleash on Stormcloaks when they
breach – an Advantage they can invoke later). A mage PC could propose using the castle’s old arcane
enchanter to create a one-time ward over the gate – perhaps a Clock with 3 boxes labeled “Ward Integrity”
that ticks down as it absorbs damage. Make these ideas tangible with Fate mechanics: the ward might be an
Aspect “Magical Ward on the Gate” with 3 free invokes (or 3 stress boxes) that Stormcloaks must
overcome before the gate can fall. The PCs may be the ones manning that ward, feeling each shudder as
axes hit.
Balgruuf will address the garrison with a somber pride: “I have no wish to shed Nord blood on my
doorstep… but neither will I hand Whiterun to Ulfric on a plate. We hold the line here. For Whiterun, and for
the Empire.” This is a potent moment for an Empathy or Leadership roll from a PC to bolster morale.
Success might give the troops an Aspect “Whiterun Stands United”. Failure could instead introduce “Fear
in the Ranks” if the soldiers doubt they can resist the Stormcloak onslaught; Hadvar or the PCs will have to
work harder during the battle to keep order. Hadvar himself can be seen reciting a quiet prayer to Talos
under his breath (a subtle character beat: even some Empire loyalists still worship Talos in secret 19 ,
showing his inner conflict). If a PC notices and has similar leanings, this forms a bond (“You too honor the
Ninth Divine?”). If a Thalmor observer were around, they’d bristle – but none are present… yet.
By the end of this briefing, Imperial PCs should know their roles: whether manning the main gate defense,
patrolling the ramparts as mobile responders, or guarding a key location like the Skyforge (which could be a
target for the enemy to demoralize Whiterun). Issue Fate Point awards or compels as appropriate: e.g.,
compel an Imperial PC’s “By the Book Soldier” aspect to insist on a strict formation (which might later be a
hindrance if creativity is needed). Or reward a bold plan with an extra Fate Point to the group pot,
symbolizing the resources allocated to their idea.
Balgruuf gives a final nod: “May the Gods watch over us.” A horn sounds from outside – the Stormcloak
army has arrived at the gates. Battle is upon you. Proceed to the siege scene appropriate to the faction.
Neutral/Independent PCs in Whiterun:
If the party is not aligned to either side explicitly, they might be present in Whiterun as the attack begins.
Options for their involvement:
- Companions: If any PC is a member of the Companions (or the whole party is a band of Companions),
Kodlak Whitemane or Aela will call them to defend the people of Whiterun. “We’re not political,” Kodlak
growls, “but we’ll be damned if we let our home burn.” The Companions take up arms primarily to protect
7
citizens and quell chaos, not to advance either faction. The GM can direct neutral PCs to tasks like
evacuating the marketplace, slaying any pillagers (on either side), or rescuing the wounded. They might end
up fighting both Stormcloak raiders and Imperial deserters who take advantage of the confusion. This can
create complex choices – e.g., do they stop a vengeful Nord militia from torching a known Imperial
household?
- College of Winterhold: A mage PC could be in Whiterun researching at Arcadia’s Cauldron or visiting
Farengar Secret-Fire (the Jarl’s court wizard). As battle looms, Farengar eagerly plans to test a scroll of
Fireball on the attackers. The College’s stance is officially neutral, but an individual mage might choose to
assist Whiterun’s defense (scholars often lean Imperial for stability) or simply protect innocents with wards.
A PC mage might be asked by Balgruuf to help maintain the magical ward on the gate (if that was
established), or by a friend in the city to ensure the Gildergreen (sacred tree of Kynareth) isn’t destroyed.
- Dark Brotherhood: If a PC assassin is present, they could have been shadowing a target in Whiterun
when all Oblivion broke loose. The Side Plot for them might involve their target (say, a minor noble or even
the Jarl) being marked for death amid the chaos. In the middle of the siege, an assassin PC might slip away
to fulfill or thwart a contract. Perhaps the Thalmor (secretly) hired the Brotherhood to eliminate Jarl
Balgruuf during the confusion – a contract the PC might know of or even be assigned to! This puts them in a
moral bind: do they defend the Jarl or carry out the assassination? This can foreshadow Thalmor
manipulation if clues link the contract back to an anonymous Altmer benefactor.
For neutral parties, emphasize moral conflict. They aren’t duty-bound to Stormcloak or Imperial orders, so
they must define their own purpose. Encourage them (with player input) to set goals like “Minimize civilian
casualties” or “Ensure our faction’s interests are secure (e.g., retrieve a Companions heirloom from the
burning hall if needed).” Mechanically, they can treat the battle as a Challenge where success on various
objectives (like an Athletics test to carry water to douse fires, a Fight roll to take down an arsonist, a Rapport
to calm panicked townsfolk) yields a victory condition: e.g., if they accumulate 3 successes before 3 failures,
“Whiterun Civilians Safe” could be an outcome Aspect. Failures might mean some lives lost or property
destroyed, affecting mood and future scenes.
Once the stage is set for all parties, move to the core action: the siege combat itself.
Scene 3: The Battle for Whiterun – Siege and Storm
This is the first major Conflict of the campaign – a large-scale battle. It should be run cinematically, with the
PCs’ actions deciding key turning points. We’ll break it into phases and note differences for Stormcloak vs.
Imperial experiences. The GM may handle this as a series of zones (Whiterun’s main gate, the marketplace,
the wall ramparts, etc.) and Waves of enemies, or as a dramatic challenge with a clock for the battle’s
progress. We suggest using a “Siege of Whiterun” clock – perhaps 6 segments – representing which side is
nearing victory. PCs can add ticks to their advantage by accomplishing objectives (raising their flag on the
gate, defeating an enemy commander, etc.), while certain events (the ram breaking through, a section of
wall collapsing) add ticks to the enemy’s side. You might even use two opposed clocks: City Falls vs City
Holds, filling one or the other based on outcomes of clashes.
Battlefield Aspects: The chaos of siege warfare provides plenty of environment aspects. Some examples to
establish: “Blazing Fires in the Streets”, “Panicked Citizens Underfoot”, “Sturdy Stone Wall (Whiterun’s
outer wall)”, “Rubble and Debris” (from catapult strikes), and “Raging Rainstorm” (perhaps Kynareth
sends rain to quell the flames – or just as dramatic weather). PCs and NPCs can invoke these for advantage
8
or the GM can compel them: e.g., compel Blazing Fires on a Stormcloak to force them to detour, or invoke
Rubble to give a PC archer a steady rest for their bow.
Stormcloak Side – Taking Whiterun:
Stormcloak PCs begin outside the gates amid the assault. The first phase is breaching the gates. Galmar
Stone-Fist leads a charge with the battering ram under a hail of arrows. The PCs could be holding the ram
(requiring Physique checks as a group effort Overcome each exchange to break it down), or providing cover
to the ram team. Perhaps one PC handles a siege catapult acquired earlier – each successful shoot action
with it could reduce a gate “stress track.” Here you can treat the City Gate as an opponent with, say, 3 stress
boxes and a Moderate consequence (“Gate Splintered”). The Stormcloaks must overcome it to enter. If the
PCs had set up advantages in the War Council (like soaked the gate in oil stealthily, etc.), allow them to
invoke those now for extra damage.
About two exchanges in, Whiterun’s defenders will unleash a volley of flaming arrows or drop rocks. One
PC (or a nameless Stormcloak at GM’s whim) might take a hit – offer a Minor Consequence “Arrow Burn
Wound”. This is a good time for a Compel: perhaps compel a PC’s Brash Berserker aspect to charge ahead
alone on a ladder, separating them on top of the wall (new zone) surrounded by enemies. If they accept,
Fate Point awarded, and now they have a solo scene atop the rampart fighting off 2-3 guards – a heroic but
risky position! They could create the Aspect “Distracted Defenders” if they hold them off, helping
comrades below. Other PCs might need to rescue them or use Create Advantage (like firing an arrow to cut
a rope that drops a banner on some guards). Encourage creative stunts – e.g., a PC Nord might use “Battle
Cry” stunt to intimidate a section of guards, forcing them back (maybe an area-of-effect provoke attack
causing a mild fear consequence on the NPCs).
Once the gate is breached (perhaps with a satisfying crash and cheer), the second phase moves into
Whiterun’s streets. Stormcloak PCs can now push into the market district. Describe vivid chaos: merchants’
stalls overturned, a house on fire (the Bannered Mare inn, perhaps). Whiterun’s Battle-Born clan (loyal to
the Empire) are actually taking up arms too – you might show old Olfrid Battle-Born and sons firing from
windows at Stormcloaks. Meanwhile, the Gray-Manes (secret Stormcloak sympathizers) might be helping
Stormcloak wounded to cover. This gives a sense of the city’s own split and may present a social choice: do
Stormcloak PCs focus on military targets or also ensure their local allies (Gray-Manes) are safe from
reprisals? If a PC has the Aspect “Skyrim’s People First”, compel them to prioritize rescuing a Gray-Mane
child from a burning house instead of chasing an enemy officer.
A key objective for Stormcloaks here could be reaching Dragonsreach (the keep) at the top. But first, Jarl
Balgruuf himself enters the fray in the streets, clad in armor and swinging his hammer Wuthrad (if you
fancy a lore moment – maybe he wields the ancient axe of Ysgramor loaned by the Companions). Balgruuf,
defended by Irileth and Housecarl Hrongar, makes a stand at the Gildergreen tree in the Wind District. He
shouts for the attackers to turn back or face the wrath of a true Nord and his companions. This is an
opportunity for a dramatic confrontation. The PCs might duel Irileth or other notable NPCs here while
soldiers clash around. If a Stormcloak PC tries to convince Balgruuf to surrender (maybe appealing to his
care for his people, reminding him Whiterun need not be destroyed), that could be handled as a Contest of
Rapport vs. his stubborn Will. A victory might get Balgruuf to yield later with honor if pressed enough. More
likely, the fight must play out.
Major NPC Notes (Battle of Whiterun):
- Ralof (Stormcloak NPC Ally) – He fights alongside the PCs if present. Give him an Aspect “Fiercely Loyal
9
Stormcloak” and a Stunt like Brotherhood in Battle: Because Ralof never abandons a shield-brother, once per
conflict he can intercept an attack meant for a nearby ally. Use him cinematically – maybe he saves a PC from
an ambushing Imperial with a timely axe throw. Ralof’s presence should add heart; he might utter, “By Shor,
we’re really doing this,” with equal parts sorrow and determination as he fights fellow Nords of Whiterun.
- Balgruuf the Greater – He is a staunch fighter but not reckless. If badly wounded (e.g., taken a Moderate or
Severe consequence “Cracked Ribs”), he’ll fall back toward the keep. If the Stormcloaks seem to clearly have
won, he will yield rather than have his city utterly ruined, telling his Housecarl to stand down. The
Stormcloaks then would capture him.
- Irileth – The Dunmer housecarl might duel a PC rogue or mage. She has an Aspect “Unflinching
Protector” (and could be compelled to fight to the death unless Balgruuf specifically orders her to live on).
- Hadvar (if somehow present with Stormcloaks?) – Unlikely; he’s on the other side. But if the PCs managed to
talk during Helgen and remain friendly, maybe they spot him on the wall as an enemy. Locking eyes, there’s
recognition – a potential compel for later. They might even trade a few shouted words mid-battle (“You don’t
have to do this!” “I gave my oath to the Legion, friend – Talos protect you.”). This humanizes the conflict.
Ultimately, the Stormcloak goal is to force Balgruuf’s surrender and raise the Stormcloak banner over
Whiterun. The final phase could be storming Dragonsreach. However, given the chaos, it might be achieved
by negotiation if enough key NPCs are down. Outcome – Stormcloak Victory: If the PCs and Stormcloaks
defeat Balgruuf’s forces, the Jarl surrenders Whiterun. A cheer goes up: Whiterun is in Stormcloak hands.
Ulfric arrives (later, after the fighting) to commend the heroes. He names Vignar Gray-Mane as the new Jarl
20 , and the Stormcloak banner is hoisted atop Dragonsreach. The city’s strategic value is immense: with
Whiterun taken, the Stormcloaks now have the central hold and can threaten all Imperial positions 8 . PCs
are hailed as heroes of the assault (likely earning a couple of Fate Points for completing this milestone). But
they also witness the cost: buildings smoldering, soldiers tending wounded, families grieving. The act
should close with a mix of triumph and somber reflection. Perhaps Ralof thanks them quietly: “My sister’s
family made it through safely, thanks to you pulling that burning timber off her house.” That personal touch
anchors the victory.
Outcome – Stormcloak Defeat (Alternate): It’s possible (though unlikely in the game’s narrative, the GM
can allow it for dramatic effect) that the Stormcloak attack fails – say the PCs make grave errors or flee, or
Balgruuf’s forces rout them. In this case, many Stormcloaks retreat or are captured. If PCs survive, they may
have to escape Whiterun under pursuit or conceal themselves among sympathizers until nightfall. Ulfric’s
army is repelled this day. This will significantly alter Act II: Stormcloaks would regroup for a second attempt
or shift strategy (maybe attacking the Reach first to avoid Whiterun for now). The module can proceed with
the war continuing, but the Imperials will hold Whiterun in the interim, bolstering Imperial morale. GMs
should adapt by perhaps compressing some later battles or having Ulfric attempt a different approach (like
obtaining an Elder Scroll… though that goes into the fantastical). Ensure the PCs still have paths forward –
maybe they must rescue Ralof from execution after the failed attack (a side mission) or regain Ulfric’s trust.
This failure branch can be extremely interesting, highlighting the tragedy of war (not every heroic charge
succeeds). However, for scope, we’ll assume the default path is Stormcloak success at Whiterun, since the
rest of the Acts anticipate progression. But we encourage keeping this loss-outcome in your back pocket if
drama calls for it.
Imperial Side – Defending Whiterun:
For Imperial-aligned PCs, flip the perspective. They start on the walls or at the main gate, bracing for
impact.
10
First phase: Hold the Gate. The Stormcloaks’ ram pounds the reinforced gate. Imperial PCs might be
coordinating arrow volleys or dumping boiling oil. One PC could command a squad of archers – treat that
like an Advantage “Disciplined Archers” they create and can invoke as a free tag when an enemy rushes.
Each round the gate holds is a success for them. Perhaps set a simple clock “Gate Breach” with 4 boxes –
ticking as the ram hits (maybe one per round unless PCs do something to slow it). PCs could sally out
through a side postern gate to sabotage the ram (a risky maneuver, but a cool mini-mission: fight through a
few Stormcloak elites, maybe plant a keg of firepowder on the ram). If they try this, narrate it as a quick
outside-the-walls skirmish under fire. A successful Sabotage could add the Aspect “Ram in Flames”, halving
the attackers’ effectiveness. But being outside might expose them to being cut off – Hadvar or another NPC
might have to open the sally gate again under covering fire to let them back in (nice tension scene).
On the wall, give each PC a moment: e.g., a ranger-type PC can target the Stormcloak flag-bearer with a
bow shot. Dropping the bear-banner can impose “Stormcloak Disarray” for a bit, a moral blow. A mage PC
could unleash a lightning bolt at the siege tower (if Stormcloaks have one), perhaps blowing it apart (invoke
“Storm Clouds Gathered” if any to supercharge it). Use NPC calls to action: Legate Cipius yells from one
tower, “Hold, you bastards, hold!” and perhaps gets hit by an arrow (taking a Moderate consequence “Arrow
to Shoulder”). He might drop, leaving an opportunity for a PC to take command of his sector – a chance
for leadership. If they do, they might later get promoted (reputation boost).
Second phase: Wall Breach and Street Fighting. Likely the Stormcloaks manage to force entry (in The
Elder Scrolls lore, Whiterun falls to Stormcloaks if the player sides with them, so either outcome is possible;
we show both). If the gate falls, or siege towers unload Stormcloaks onto the battlements, now Imperial PCs
fight within the city. Set scenes in key locations: the market, near Jorrvaskr (the Companions’ hall), and by
the Gildergreen tree. The Imperials must protect Jarl Balgruuf and push the Stormcloaks back out.
A fun twist: A Stormcloak battering ram team bursts through the gate, but as they charge in, they trigger a
trap the PCs suggested – e.g., spikes hidden in the ground or a palisade funnel. Describe Stormcloak
soldiers impaled or stumbling – giving the PCs a momentary upper hand. At this point, you can introduce a
Stormcloak named NPC (maybe Ralof if he’s alive and the PCs met him in Helgen, now on the opposite side).
Ralof might recognize the PCs atop the wall or on the field: “Hadvar! You damn milk-drinker, I knew I’d find
you here!” If Hadvar is an NPC ally to the PCs, he can engage in a brief duel of words with Ralof before
swords, illustrating two friends now foes. Perhaps Ralof calls out a PC Nord: “You fight for them? The
Thalmor’s pawns?!” This can be a mental attack via provoke on the PC’s belief – compel their Nord Pride to
shake them. Resolving this could be roleplayed: the PC might shout back, “I fight to protect our people, not
tear our home apart!” – if well-said, that could even stun Ralof (remove an invoke of Stormcloak morale).
This personal touch makes the battle more than nameless enemies.
Major objective for Imperials: Keep Jarl Balgruuf Safe and Hold Dragonsreach. Possibly at some point,
Stormcloaks make a push for Dragonsreach (with Ulfric’s axe-wielding lieutenant, Galmar, at the forefront).
Imperial PCs could form the last line of defense in the throne room. Picture a cinematic showdown: Galmar
and a couple of Stormcloak officers smash into the hall. A PC stands guard before Balgruuf’s throne while
the Jarl, wounded, tries to pull himself to fight. Legate Rikke might even arrive as reinforcement if you want
to include her (she’s likely at Solitude at first, but could belatedly come). Regardless, the PCs might directly
duel Galmar Stone-Fist here. Give Galmar an appropriate profile: Aspect “Old Bear of the Stormcloaks”,
with a Stunt like Blood on the Snow: Galmar gets +2 to attack when he’s taken a consequence (fighting harder
wounded). This makes him a tough foe who actually becomes more dangerous as he’s injured. The fight with
Galmar could be pivotal: if he is defeated (or even killed, if you allow that – though Galmar is plot-important
11
on Stormcloak side, the GM might choose not to have him die here unless planning big deviations), the
Stormcloaks’ morale plunges and they may retreat. If he overpowers the PCs, he might hold Balgruuf at
axe-point, forcing surrender.
Imperial Victory in Whiterun (Repelling the Stormcloaks): If the Imperials hold, the Stormcloak forces
withdraw after heavy losses. Whiterun’s citizens rejoice cautiously – but Balgruuf is grim, knowing this was
just the first battle. Tullius arrives later, clapping the PCs on the shoulder: “Well done. You’ve proven the
Legion isn’t just foreign generals – Skyrim’s own sons and daughters fought bravely here.” He likely rewards
them (perhaps a Promotion aspect like “Proven Defender of Whiterun” which might grant an honor or
medal they can invoke socially in Imperial territories). Hadvar is relieved his home (Riverwood, nearby) is
safe for now. But there’s fallout: parts of Whiterun are damaged (the outer gate smashed, a section of wall
broken), and whispers spread that the Thalmor might be pleased – since Skyrim weakened itself today,
regardless of victor 21 . Balgruuf thanks the PCs personally, offering them mead in Dragonsreach and
voicing his sorrow that Nords had to kill Nords. “This cannot be what Talos wants for us,” he muses, setting
a tone of regret. The war will go on, however, and the Legion now has momentum to strike back at Ulfric’s
holdings.
Stormcloak Victory in Whiterun (Alternate, if Imperials fail): Should the players badly fail and Whiterun
fall under their watch, it’s a dark moment. Balgruuf is exiled or captured, Imperial troops retreat if possible.
PCs might have to escape as the city falls (perhaps carrying a grievously wounded Hadvar out of the
carnage). This sets a very different tone for Act II – Imperials on the back foot, regrouping to defend the
next hold. The campaign can still proceed, but likely with an urgent drive to reclaim Whiterun later. The
PCs might be blamed by superiors (unfairly or fairly) for the loss; they may seek redemption by
extraordinary heroics in upcoming battles. It can be a powerful motivator. GMs could incorporate an event
where General Tullius, furious, says, “We’ll retake Whiterun if it’s the last thing we do – and you, my friends,
will be at the tip of the spear.” The next acts would then include a detour to reclaim Whiterun. However, for
the standard path, we’ll assume Imperials successfully defend Whiterun in Act I (since that aligns with
many playthroughs and because either side can plausibly win here).
Neutral Party in the Battle:
Neutral PCs will have their own measures of success aside from the city’s fate. After the battle, gauge how
well they accomplished their personal objectives: Did they save all the civilians they intended to? Did they
keep the Temple of Kynareth from burning, or slay that rampaging frost troll someone let loose from the
palace menagerie (you can throw in a random chaotic event like that for fun)? If they succeeded, reward
them with positive aspects like “Trusted by Whiterun Citizens” (the people saw them help). If they failed in
some tasks (perhaps they saved many but couldn’t prevent a portion of the city from igniting), impose a
temporary aspect “Haunted by Whiterun’s Flames” on one or more PCs, representing trauma or guilt –
this can be compelled in future scenes where similar stakes arise, driving home war’s cost. Neutral PCs
might not shift the macro outcome of who holds Whiterun, but they could influence how much
destruction occurs or who survives. For example, if they worked to minimize violence, maybe Jarl
Balgruuf’s children and family are safely escorted out before Stormcloaks breach (preventing a tragic
massacre). That can have story value later (those family members might later beseech aid to rescue
Balgruuf or thank the PCs). Or if they prioritized taking out key aggressors, maybe the battle ends quicker.
Decide based on their actions whether Whiterun fell to Stormcloaks or not; neutrals could tip balance if they
choose a side mid-battle (e.g., the Companions ultimately side with Balgruuf, turning the tide to Imperials –
or maybe they side with Stormcloaks if something sways them). You as GM can justifiably choose whichever
outcome serves the ongoing story or the players’ leanings, since neutral PCs give some freedom. Just

ensure the consequences of Act I naturally lead to Act II’s scenarios (we provide for both faction control
maps).
Aftermath of Act I: Whiterun’s New Dawn
As the smoke clears, Act I concludes with a brief epilogue scene in Whiterun. Give the players a moment to
breathe and roleplay: perhaps at Jorrvaskr mead hall, whether in victory or defeat. If Stormcloaks won,
they may be attending a victory gathering in the great hall of Dragonsreach; if Imperials won, maybe a field
hospital scene in the Temple of Kynareth, treating wounded. This is an Interlude where consequences can
be healed (bandage wounds, drink to numb pain) and relationships deepened.
Encourage each player to reflect in-character on what just happened. A somber Nord might lament fighting
kinsmen. A fierce one might celebrate glory in battle. A clever one might already worry: “Ulfric/Tullius won’t
stop now. This was just the beginning.” Offer a Fate Point if a PC’s Trouble could surface here – e.g., a PC
with “PTSD from the Great War” might suffer a panic attack at the smell of ash (compel that to have them
step outside for air, where an NPC follows to comfort them, providing a touching scene). Or a young
idealistic soldier PC might over-celebrate, only to be confronted by a distraught civilian (“My home… my
shop… it’s gone.”), tempering their zeal.
Also, foreshadow the Thalmor strongly here for the first time. Perhaps while tending the wounded, Hadvar
(Imperial) quietly confides to a PC he trusts: “Legate Fasendil told me something… he suspects the Thalmor
are pulling strings to keep this war raging 22 . After today, I believe it. Who really won? The elves must be
laughing.” If Stormcloak side, maybe Ralof mentions, “Mark my words, the Thalmor will come sniffing. They
always do – like crows after a battle.” These comments plant seeds that there’s a bigger picture. PCs with
Lore or contacts could even find a clue: maybe among the corpses, an Imperial PC finds a Stormcloak
soldier’s orders that oddly include an addendum in Aldmeri script (some coded Thalmor note). Or vice
versa: a Stormcloak PC finds an Imperial missive referencing Elenwen, the Thalmor ambassador, subtly.
They likely can’t decode it yet, but the detail is there.
Finally, reward and recognition: If Stormcloaks took Whiterun, Ulfric might send a personal message
thanking the heroes and promising them a stake in the new Skyrim (perhaps a minor treasure or a field
promotion to “Ice-Veins” rank). If Imperials held it, General Tullius might arrive by horse to congratulate
them, or Jarl Balgruuf promises to remember their service (a potential title or gift of a weapon named in
their honor down the line). These rewards can be abstracted as Aspect permissions – e.g., “Hero of
Whiterun” aspect can be invoked in social situations in that hold for respect, or to requisition supplies from
locals.
With Whiterun’s fate decided, Act I ends. The Civil War is now in full blaze. The hold map of Skyrim shifts:
Whiterun belongs to whoever prevailed, and both factions lick their wounds and strategize the next moves.
The players have forged their reputations in fire and blood. Ahead lies a wider war across Skyrim’s nine
holds – and more hidden perils as the Thalmor and Daedric influences begin to surface in earnest. Gather
the war maps and prepare for Act II – the flames of conflict spread to every corner of the land.
