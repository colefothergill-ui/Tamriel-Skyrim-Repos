Act IV: The Final Storm – Siege of Solitude/Windhelm and The
Thalmor Gambit
Summary: Act IV is the climax of the campaign. The civil war comes to its final battle: either the
Stormcloaks’ siege of Solitude or the Imperial assault on Windhelm, depending on which side the PCs
support (or potentially both, if the party has members on each side or if a negotiation led to a joint focus
against the Thalmor; we’ll accommodate both possibilities). Parallel to this grand battle, the Thalmor
execute their endgame plan: a covert (or overt) operation to sabotage the victor and tighten Aldmeri
Dominion control over Skyrim. This could manifest as an attempted assassination of Ulfric and Tullius
both, a plan to unleash a Daedric horror during the battle, or even an effort to retrieve/destroy a significant
artifact (like the Jagged Crown or some symbol of Skyrim’s royalty) to prevent unity. The PCs must fight on
the front lines of the battle and likely break away at a critical moment to thwart the Thalmor’s scheme.
Major NPCs like Hadvar and Ralof will reach their ultimate fate or reconciliation in this Act. By the end, one
faction wins the war – but the focus is on ensuring Skyrim isn’t left vulnerable to the Thalmor in victory or
29
defeat. The epilogue then ties up the PCs’ personal journeys, the political aftermath, and possibly an
appearance or acknowledgment by the Dragonborn (as a legendary figure giving them kudos or gifts).
Structure: We will outline the final battle from both perspectives (Stormcloak attack on Solitude and
Imperial attack on Windhelm). There’s a lot of symmetry: both cities are the enemy’s capital, heavily
fortified, with the faction leader present (Ulfric in Windhelm, Tullius and Elisif in Solitude). In each case,
incorporate the third-party Thalmor interference as a timed event or clock that if not stopped could ruin
everything. The PCs will likely have to make tough choices: do they pursue the primary objective (defeating
the enemy leader) or divert to stop the Thalmor plot when it emerges? Ideally, they delegate or split party
to handle both – cinematic multitasking. Branches from Act III matter: e.g., if a truce happened, maybe an
unusual scenario occurs where some Imperials assist Stormcloaks to remove Thalmor influences in Solitude
or vice versa, at least for a crucial hour. Or if no truce, the PCs might individually choose to prioritize killing
the opposing leader or joining forces to strike the Thalmor first. The module should allow the PCs to be
heroes by making the wise call (likely foiling Thalmor plan even if it means the war outcome is slightly
altered).
Let’s break down by perspective:
Stormcloak Path – “Battle for Solitude” & The Thalmor’s Trap
Prelude: Ulfric’s host surrounds Solitude, the great coastal capital 35 . Solitude’s blue banners of the
Empire fly high; General Tullius commands defense from Castle Dour, and Jarl Elisif rallies what troops she
can (though her heart is heavy without her husband, Torygg). The mood is tense: Solitude expects a brutal
siege, but perhaps underestimates Ulfric’s fury after all the Thalmor revelations. Ulfric addresses his
Stormcloaks: “Today, we cast down the last puppet of the Empire, and tear out the Thalmor threat by its roots!”
He’s combining goals: He likely intends to execute General Tullius (and perhaps Elisif) to end Imperial rule,
but also has quietly told Galmar to hunt down any Thalmor agents inside the city – he’s wary of more
treachery. The PCs as his elite team are tasked with spearheading a breach and specifically to secure the
Emperor’s cousin (if she’s present, like Vittoria Vici) or any high-profile hostages – because Ulfric suspects
the Thalmor might try something with them (maybe intelligence says the Thalmor plot involves harming
such figures to prolong conflict). Essentially, Ulfric trusts the PCs now to look out for the unseen threats even
as the main force battles. Ralof is at the PC’s side, determined to see this through, but he confides privately
that this victory feels different: “I used to think it would be Sovngarde-grand. But now I just want it over so we
can deal with the real enemy.” He’s implying his hatred has shifted from Empire to Thalmor. This is huge
character growth.
Siege Start: Solitude’s main gate (at the end of a long arching bridge) is heavily defended 36 . Catapults
from Stormcloaks bombard the walls. The initial assault is brutal: Stormcloaks push across the bridge under
withering arrow fire. The PCs can lead from the front or take a side route: maybe climbing along the rocky
sides of the arch to flank a tower (Athletics challenge, failure means a perilous dangling but maybe they
recover). They likely have to break the gate with a battering ram or explosive. If they recovered any Dwemer
tech from Markarth, now’s a time to use it (maybe they rig a repurposed ballista as a door-breaching
crossbow). They smash through and Stormcloaks flood into Solitude’s lower city (the marketplace by the
docks). Street-to-street fighting ensues.
City Combat Highlights:
- Solitude’s layout has narrow alleys and grand plazas (the Bards College area, etc.). The Bards College
30
ironically might be playing intense martial music audible even over battle – one poetic Bard decided to
score the battle. PCs could invoke “Inspirational War Ballad Echoing” for courage or distraction.
- The Blue Palace (Elisif’s palace) is on one end, Castle Dour (military HQ) on the other near the gate. Likely
Ulfric wants Tullius found in Castle Dour and Elisif in Blue Palace. They probably split forces: Galmar leads
some to Castle Dour, while PCs perhaps are sent to secure Blue Palace. Ulfric himself fights where the battle
is thickest (maybe at Castle Dour after gate, or moving between).
- Civilians: Many Solitude civilians (merchants, etc.) hide or flee to the docks. Some misguidedly take up
arms for their city (PCs might face not just soldiers but an irate shopkeeper swinging a pan – do they knock
out or kill such non-combatants? Morality test!). Possibly, remember Jarl Balgruuf and others exiled from
Whiterun are actually in Solitude’s basement if they were ousted 32 . If Stormcloaks find them, will they
harm those refugees? PC Stormcloaks could decide to show mercy, scoring moral points.
Thalmor Interference: At some point mid-battle, possibly when Stormcloaks seem to have the upper hand,
the Thalmor spring their trap. A few ideas:
- Assassination attempt on Ulfric: Elenwen (if not killed at the peace council or earlier) may have a last
resort plan. Example: disguised as an injured refugee, she gets close to Ulfric with a hidden dagger
envenomed in some terrible poison. A PC might notice this (“that refugee’s eyes glint with too much
hatred”) and intervene. This could be a quick time event – if they fail, Ulfric gets stabbed. Perhaps he has a
chance to survive but is weakened (taking a Severe consequence “Poisoned Wound”). If they succeed, they
expose and stop her – maybe Ralof or PC kills Elenwen, fulfilling his vow. But if Ulfric goes down, the
Stormcloak assault falters (some might think him dead). The PCs might need to rally them (shouting “For
Ulfric, for Skyrim!” with a Leadership roll to create “Unbroken Stormcloak Morale”). Ulfric’s survival or not
will dramatically alter ending – presumably PC will try to save him (maybe an antidote exists, could tie to
something from Vaermina’s temple that cures exotic poisons, if they got such an item).
- Summoned Creature or Daedric Beast: The Thalmor, cornered, might unleash a bound Daedra in the
streets – e.g., a Storm Atronach or even enslaved dragon (though Thalmor using a dragon might be far-
fetched, but possible through some twisted magic, or an undead dragon? That’s very high fantasy but it’s
finale!). The PCs would have to break off to fight that monster rampaging among soldiers of both sides
(again a scenario where for a moment Stormcloaks and Imperials both run from or tackle the beast). That
fight can be a set-piece: e.g., a Storm Atronach towering, hurling lightning – PCs can use environment (lead
it near wet docks then tip over metal anchor chain to short-circuit it – a clever overcome to destroy it
without direct confrontation).
- Kidnap/Hostage scenario: Perhaps Thalmor agents grab Jarl Elisif amid chaos and threaten to kill her (or
actually plan to take her to Alinor) thus depriving Skyrim of a peaceful figurehead for post-war (Thalmor
would love to martyr her to inflame Nords or, conversely, kill Ulfric to decapitate Stormcloaks). If PC
Stormcloaks come across this – do they save the Imperial Jarl? If they don’t, the Thalmor kill her – which
possibly cheats Ulfric of legitimacy (he might have wanted her to publicly yield to him to unify Skyrim). This
could also be Ralof’s arc test: He used to hate the Empire so would he care to save Elisif? Maybe yes, if he’s
grown – “She’s not our enemy, not truly.” This can be an emotional rescue scene. If saved, Elisif perhaps
yields gracefully to Ulfric after seeing Stormcloaks aren’t monsters (especially the PC actions). If not saved,
Ulfric actually might mourn in his own way (he didn’t wish her dead, in fact planned to try to marry or
negotiate with her in some fan theories). This can sow regret.
Climax at Castle Dour/Palace: Eventually the final fight is either Ulfric vs. Tullius in Castle Dour’s war room,
or if Ulfric was incapacitated, maybe the PCs do it. Ideally, Ulfric (if alive and present) should get his
confrontation with General Tullius as in game – perhaps with PC at his side. Tullius is a seasoned fighter; he
and Ulfric duel while PC deals with Legate Rikke interfering or other guards. In a dramatic moment, Tullius
31
is beaten to his knees. Ulfric either executes him or the PC can influence showing mercy. If the PC argues
for mercy (maybe citing that unity against Thalmor is needed and spilling more Imperial blood will hinder
that), Ulfric might actually listen if respect was earned. He could instead order Tullius to leave Skyrim in exile
humiliated. That drastically improves chances of reconciliation later. If the PC stays silent or agrees with
Ulfric’s vengeance, Ulfric likely has Ralof execute Tullius with the axe (or does it himself if he wasn’t
wounded). This fulfills the Stormcloak ambition but leaves a bitter note. Either way, that effectively ends
organized Imperial resistance. Elisif’s fate: if alive and present, Ulfric might spare her (especially if PC
encouraged mercy) and even allow her to remain Jarl of Solitude under him (which in UESP note he does to
legitimize his rule 37 ). If she died by Thalmor, Ulfric appoints someone (maybe PC, if a noble or such? Or
keeps Elisif’s steward Falk Firebeard to ease transition). This could be player’s decision if they have influence
– maybe they ensure a stable, fair person gets the role.
Stormcloak Victory Epilogue: Ulfric Stormcloak is now High King of Skyrim (by right of conquest). The war
is won. There’s jubilation among Stormcloaks, yet also tremendous rebuilding and mending to do. Ulfric
addresses the crowd in Solitude’s plaza: “We have thrown off the yoke of the Empire! But our true enemy
remains – we shall ready ourselves for the day the Dominion comes for us. By Shor, they will find us united!”
– This sets stage for future struggle vs Thalmor. He thanks the PCs individually, perhaps offering them titles
(Thanehood in a hold, or even governorship of a hold that lost its Jarl). E.g., if PC is a Nord of good standing,
Ulfric might name them Jarl of Whiterun or even give them an heirloom weapon (War Axe of Eastmarch,
etc.).
Ralof’s arc ends with him somewhat somber amid victory – he likely visits the graves of fallen friends
(maybe Laila or Galmar if they died) and vows to ensure their sacrifice isn’t wasted by falling for Thalmor
tricks again. He possibly accepts a promotion (maybe becomes Ulfric’s new general now that Galmar might
have died or retired). Alternatively, if Ulfric was gravely poisoned and perhaps needs time to heal, Ralof
could step up as an acting leader in interim or support whoever Ulfric picks. Ralof thanks the PC for opening
his eyes to bigger picture and says, “You’ll always have a brother in me.” (If PC was very anti-Empire before,
maybe they had growth too, acknowledging some Imperials fought honorably. If PC was moderate or
Imperial-sympathizing, Ralof definitely changed because of them).
The Thalmor threat is diminished for now: many agents were slain or chased off. Possibly one high-ranking
Thalmor (if Elenwen escaped or another) slunk away and might plot revenge (sequel hook). The campaign
could end on a note: Skyrim is free but must stand vigilant.
Imperial Path – “Battle for Windhelm” & The Thalmor’s Last Stand
Prelude: General Tullius marshals the Legion for the final strike on Windhelm 38 . This is it: Ulfric’s
stronghold, ancient city of Ysgramor. The Imperial army, bolstered by regained holds, travels to Eastmarch.
Tullius, though stoic, perhaps addresses his troops: “The rebellion ends today. We will show Ulfric and his
followers no quarter until they lay down their arms. But remember – the Thalmor would see us fight forever.
Let’s finish this with honor.” This acknowledges the recent revelations. He privately instructs the PCs on a
special task: to secure Ulfric Stormcloak alive if possible, because Titus Mede (the Emperor) may want him
for negotiation – and also to foil any Thalmor plan to martyr Ulfric. Legate Rikke agrees strongly; she’s Nord
and doesn’t relish killing a hero of her people, even if an enemy. Hadvar stands ready, resolved but
saddened (he’s likely lost friends on both sides by now).
32
Windhelm expects them. The city has thick snow, giving cover to approaches. Possibly a giant storm is
raging (either natural or maybe the Court Wizard does something). The Stormcloak camp inside is
prepared to fight to last. Ulfric likely gave a similar rousing speech to his men at the Palace of Kings: “If it is
to die today, we die for Skyrim!” There’s despair but determination. Notably, if Act III’s peace talk happened,
Ulfric might secretly instruct some loyalists: “If I fall, don’t continue senseless bloodshed; focus on Thalmor
infiltration in our land.” That could make some Stormcloaks less zealous, maybe surrender quicker if Ulfric is
down. But initially, they fight.
Siege Start: Imperials attack the main gate of Windhelm. It’s a bone-chilling cold morning. Imperial
battering rams and mages blow through the wooden gates after heavy fighting. PCs could lead a scaling
operation – climb over an icy section of wall by the docks as a flanking maneuver. If they do, they might
encounter resistance from the Cruel-Sea family (a Windhelm family) defending their dock, which is an
interesting personal touch (maybe an old fisherman swinging an axe). They can try not to harm civilians,
etc.
City Combat Highlights:
- Windhelm’s Stone Quarter becomes a battlefield. That includes the market and the revered statue of
Talos there. If an errant fireball knocks the Talos statue down, it’s symbolic – maybe saps Stormcloak morale
(their god’s effigy toppled) but could also anger them into berserking. PC could perhaps deliberately avoid
damaging it to show respect (if PC is Nord Imperial, they may order catapults to avoid the temple). That
could earn unexpected trust from some Stormcloaks who notice “the Empire soldiers didn’t defile Talos
shrine,” aiding surrender later.
- The Gray Quarter (Dunmer district) might stay out of it mostly; Dunmer residents hide. Possibly a Dunmer
group actually opens a side gate for Imperials (out of dislike for Ulfric’s rule) – a moral complication: the
Empire benefiting from the actions of an oppressed minority. PC could take advantage or not. Legate Rikke
might caution to be careful trusting them (not out of racism but fear of trap). But it could be genuine –
Dunmer just wanting the conflict over. If accepted, Imperials slip in through Grey Quarter, bypassing a
chokepoint, making fight easier. That should be seen as an act where the Empire did what Ulfric never did –
cooperate with Dunmer.
- The Palace of Kings stands at end, where Ulfric awaits. Stormcloaks form shield walls in(continued)
Imperial Victory Epilogue: General Tullius stands in the courtyard of the Palace of Kings, Windhelm’s
banners replaced by the Imperial Dragon. The civil war is over. Jarl Elisif is soon to be crowned High Queen
by the moot (with Imperial backing), promising to honor Nord traditions and restore the worship of Talos
in Skyrim – an open challenge to the Dominion, but a calculated one given the revelations of Thalmor
treachery. The Empire chooses to quietly overlook this breach of the Concordat, a sign of shifting winds. A
ceremony is held in Solitude, where High Queen Elisif and General Tullius honor the heroes of the war. The
PCs are lauded as “Heroes of Skyrim and the Empire”, their names to be sung by bards for generations.
They may receive formal titles – perhaps Thane of Windhelm (to help pacify that restive city) or even
governance of a hold as envoys of the Empire. In a moving gesture, Elisif presents the Shield of Solitude to
the lead PC, an ancient relic symbolizing the defense of the realm.
Hadvar stands by in polished armor, newly promoted to Legate. His face is proud yet pensive. In a private
moment after the ceremony, Hadvar thanks the PCs: “We did it. Skyrim is unified again… under the Empire, yes,
but maybe now on our terms.” He touches the Talos amulet hidden beneath his collar and smiles – for the
White-Gold Concordat’s ban on Talos worship is effectively a dead letter in Skyrim now, an outcome
he’d quietly dreamed of. Hadvar’s arc concludes with him optimistic: he plans to help rebuild Skyrim’s
33
shattered villages and fortify against the Dominion. Perhaps he asks the PC to join him in training the new
generation of soldiers – ones who will be ready when the Dominion inevitably retaliates. His personal
Aspect “Devotion to Empire and Skyrim” has evolved – he now truly sees no difference between serving
his province and his Empire, as both strive together against the Thalmor.
If Ralof survived the final battle, he is among the Stormcloak prisoners brought before Elisif. Many expect
harsh punishment, but Elisif, guided by the PC’s counsel, extends amnesty to most ordinary Stormcloak
soldiers. Ralof steps forward, defiantly expecting execution. Instead, Elisif thanks him for his bravery
defending Skyrim (even if misguided) and, in a surprising turn, offers him a place in the new guard of
Windhelm under the Empire. This is perhaps at the PC’s urging (a compel on Ralof’s “Proud Son of Skyrim”
to accept an honorable role over martyrdom). Ralof is stunned. After a long pause, he kneels and swears an
oath – not to the Empire directly, but “to the protection of the people of Skyrim, against all who threaten us.”
Elisif accepts this wording. Ralof’s eyes meet the PC’s; there’s a mix of gratitude and lingering sorrow. His
war is over, and though his side lost, he has found a new purpose free of Ulfric’s shadow. In his heart, Ralof’s
hatred has shifted entirely toward the Thalmor – and perhaps, one day, he and Hadvar will stand side by
side when the next war comes. Their personal feud buried, Ralof even clasps Hadvar’s forearm in the old
Nord manner, a gesture of hard-won respect.
The Thalmor, for now, have been utterly exposed and routed from Skyrim. Any captured Thalmor agents
(like Ondolemar or Elenwen, if alive) are delivered in chains to the High Queen’s court. It’s decided (perhaps
by Imperial-PC influence) that these prisoners will be kept as leverage rather than executed – a move that
gives the Empire diplomatic cards to play and denies the Dominion new martyrs. In secret, General Tullius
sends word to the Emperor about the Thalmor’s orchestrations 34 24 , accompanied by the evidence the
PCs obtained. The Empire’s high leadership is forced to reckon with the uncomfortable truth that
appeasing the Dominion nearly destroyed Skyrim. There are quiet but significant shifts in policy: the Empire
begins covertly rearming for an eventual war with the Aldmeri Dominion, and Talos worship is increasingly
tolerated even outside Skyrim. While the White-Gold Concordat isn’t officially overturned, the Emperor
tacitly permits Skyrim (and its veterans) to honor Talos – a morale boost to the populace and a subtle
rebuke to the Thalmor. The PCs’ actions in revealing the Thalmor plot have thus not only saved Skyrim but
begun to change the course of the Empire itself.
In the aftermath, fate point economy in the narrative: each PC likely gains a cache of Fate Points
symbolically – they are flush with renown and goodwill after the war. The GM can highlight a few lingering
open aspects to tie off: e.g., “Maven Black-Briar’s Ambitions” – if the PC struck deals with her, note that
under Elisif’s reign Maven’s influence is checked (perhaps the PC ensured Maven was kept on a short leash
in Riften in exchange for past cooperation). “Forsworn Resurgence” – now that the war is done, the new
leadership might finally address Reachmen grievances (the PC could spearhead a diplomatic approach,
turning a former side enemy into an ally against Thalmor). These are seeds the PC can influence in epilogue
scenes, leveraging their new station to resolve Skyrim’s internal conflicts more justly.
Finally, as the PCs depart Windhelm on their journey back to Solitude or wherever they choose to settle, a
shadow passes over the sun – the silhouette of a dragon. For a moment, weapons are raised in alarm.
But the dragon (it could be Odahviing or another freed dragon) simply circles and heads off into the
northern mountains. A voice familiar to the PCs – the Dragonborn – hails them from a nearby outlook
where he stands with a smile. He gives a respectful nod and perhaps shouts a single word of the Thu’um in
their honor – not a destructive Shout, but one of glory and victory that echoes across the skies. (If a
translation is needed, Arngeir later explains it was the Old Nord word for “Unity.”) It’s a final salute from one
34
living legend to the new heroes of Skyrim. “This land endures because of heroes like you,” the Dragonborn
says quietly (or leaves carved on a tablet if one prefers a subtler cameo). “Kaal do sahrot Heim” – ’Carry on
the greatness of the Home.’* With that, the Dragonborn departs on the dragon’s back, heading into his own
next adventure, leaving the PCs to their well-earned chapter in history.
Conclusion: Skyrim’s New Dawn
The civil war has ended, but the campaign’s true finale is the transformation of Skyrim’s spirit. If
Stormcloaks prevailed, Skyrim stands free – battered but unbowed, guided by High King Ulfric (or his
successors) who now temper pride with wisdom. The Moot convenes and, under the PC’s counsel,
formalizes a policy of vigilance against the Thalmor above all. Nords, Dunmer, and other peoples of Skyrim
begin mending rifts. Perhaps the PC is present when Ulfric makes a surprising conciliatory gesture – like
commissioning a monument in Windhelm to honor “all sons and daughters of Skyrim”, including those
who fought against him, emphasizing that they are one people now. The themes of identity and
patriotism reach full circle: no longer defined by hatred of the Empire, Skyrim’s identity reforms around
protecting its sovereignty and way of life from true tyrants (the Dominion). Tragedy gives way to hope as
families reunite across battle lines – a poignant scene might be the PC witnessing a pair of soldiers from
opposite sides, now both discharged, lighting a candle together for fallen comrades of both armies. Fate
Core mechanics wise, many negative aspects (like “Civil Unrest” in each hold) can be removed as the
narrative conditions have been addressed by PC actions, while new aspects like “Pride of the Unified
Skyrim” apply, granting the land a bonus to resist outside threats (and granting PCs narrative justification
for greater resources when facing external conflicts). The PC, perhaps taking up a Jarlship or advising Ulfric,
can use their accumulated Fate Points (and goodwill) to shape policies – for instance, compelling Ulfric’s
“True Son of Skyrim” aspect to persuade him to allow a representative Moot to give all holds a voice in
governance, thereby avoiding future succession crises. Ulfric, influenced by the PC, might agree – a legacy
of ideological growth born from the campaign.
If Imperials prevailed, Skyrim remains within the Empire – but changed. The Empire, humbled by how
close it came to losing Skyrim, grants the province greater autonomy in practice. High Queen Elisif forms a
new Skyrim Council including former rebels and neutrals (perhaps the PC chairs it) to address grievances
in each hold. The moral conflicts of the war yield reforms: for example, the persecution of the Forsworn is
officially ended; Elisif (advised by the PC who recalls Markarth’s lessons) issues an edict pardoning Forsworn
fighters and inviting a summit in Markarth to negotiate peace – a use of Diplomacy by the PC on a national
scale. The PC might travel one last time to Understone Keep to oversee this meeting between Silver-Blood
representatives and Forsworn elders, resolving that long-standing intrigue with a treaty (perhaps even
involving a Fate Challenge with social rolls to calm hostilities – success yielding an Aspect “Peace in The
Reach” on the epilogue, failure meaning a simmering insurgency remains but reduced). Meanwhile, Talos
worship resumes openly – when the Thalmor angrily protest, the Empire (backed by evidence the PC
provided of Dominion misdeeds) refuses to enforce the ban, effectively nullifying that hated clause. The
White-Gold Concordat is left in tatters; the Dominion must either swallow this defiance or reveal its weak
hand post-war. A brief scene might show a Thalmor dignitary departing Elisif’s court in a fury – a victory not
just martial but ideological for the Nords. Ordinary citizens begin to see the Empire in a more positive light,
not as overlords but as fellow victors against deception.
In both outcomes, the PCs’ personal stories conclude with them at the center of Skyrim’s future. They have
become more than soldiers or adventurers – they are statesmen, peacemakers, and champions whose
decisions shape the political and spiritual landscape. Importantly, they carry the weight of the campaign’s
35
themes: identity, ideology, tragedy, patriotism, and moral conflict. They have forged an identity for Skyrim that
transcended the simple dichotomy of Empire vs. Stormcloak – forging instead a narrative of Skyrim united
against the true evils of the world. The tragedy of brother fighting brother is recorded in harrowing detail by
the Bards College (with which the PC might collaborate to ensure a truthful, healing account). Patriotism
remains, but wiser – the PC might establish, for instance, a memorial in Whiterun, on the very plains where
the war’s first full battle was fought. At its base, an inscription reads: “May future sons and daughters of
Skyrim remember: our blood is one when faced with the night.” This directly acknowledges the pain (blood
spilled) and the ultimate lesson (unity against darkness).
In a final cinematic vignette, perhaps months later, the High King/Queen (Ulfric or Elisif) holds a grand
moot or gathering at High Hrothgar – this time not for war, but for a celebration of Skyrim. Representatives
from every hold, every faction – Companions, College mages, even a reformed Thieves Guild envoy – attend.
The PCs stand at the High King/Queen’s side as honored heroes. A great horn (clock) is sounded (or a
metaphoric Fate “scene aspect” is invoked): “The Dragonborn’s Oath” – that all in attendance swear to
defend Skyrim together against any threat. The Greybeards bless the gathering with a deep resonant
“LAAS” (meaning “life” in the dragon tongue) which echoes warmly. As mead is raised and old enemies
clasp hands, the camera (so to speak) pans upward out of the hall to the clear sky above. The aurora dances
over Skyrim, vibrant and peaceful, no longer torn by war. In that sky, for a keen eye, a flash of scale and
wing might be seen – dragons still circle the world, but for now, the land of Skyrim knows peace, hard-
won and well-deserved.
Campaign Module Conclusion: The Fate Core mechanics throughout have enabled epic narratives: PCs
managed extended conflicts with countdowns (like siege progress clocks and Thalmor schemes) and felt
the weight of Consequences that carried from Act to Act (Ulfric’s poisoned wound, Ralof’s crisis of faith,
cities bearing aspects of unrest). They invoked Aspects like “True Unity” in the final moments to turn
potential tragedy into alliance. The GM should reward players with additional Fate Points for resolving
major story arcs – these can translate into lasting character Aspects on their sheets reflecting their legacy.
For example, a PC might take Aspect: “Hero of the Skyrim Civil War” or “Voice of Reconciliation” –
something that could influence any future adventures in Tamriel, marking them as a major figure. NPCs like
Hadvar and Ralof have grown from simple soldiers to nuanced friends whose personal journeys (their
psychological profiles of loyalty, doubt, and growth) reached fulfilling conclusions at the climax of Act IV,
largely thanks to the PCs’ interventions and the compels that drew out their deepest conflicts.
The final scene belongs to the players. As the new dawn’s light breaks over the Throat of the World,
painting the snow-capped peaks in gold, the PCs gather perhaps on the steps of High Hrothgar or at the
gates of Solitude/Windhelm. They reflect on the long road from Alduin’s epilogue to this moment. They
recall the battles won and lost, the friends made and fallen. They stand now not as Stormcloak or Imperial,
not as outsider or native, but as Skyrim’s champions. In this moment of hard-earned peace, allow each
player to narrate a short epilogue for their character: one might describe how they will take up the jarl’s
mantle and lead their hold with wisdom, another how they found a quiet farmstead to finally raise a
family, hanging up their sword except when duty calls again. One may plan to go dragon-hunting with the
Dragonborn, seeking new horizons with a certain gleam of adventure in their eyes (the open-ended future).
Encourage them to tie their epilogues to their aspects and consequences resolved: e.g., a PC with
“Haunted by War” might narrate how they build a veterans’ hall in Whiterun to counsel other soldiers,
turning that trouble into a positive Aspect “Healer of War’s Wounds”.
36
As a GM closing note, you might address the players out-of-character: congratulate them on steering the
fate of Skyrim and note how their choices led to this specific ending. In Fate Core style, highlight a few “Fate
Points well spent” – the clutch invoke that prevented Ulfric’s assassination, the compel that had Ralof see
reason, etc., reinforcing how their creative play truly shaped the story. This reinforces that in Fate (and in
this campaign), the players’ agency and the story’s outcome are entwined.
The skalds will craft sagas of these events. The “Campaign Aspects” that defined this module – Civil War,
Hidden Thalmor Menace, Ideals in Conflict – have been resolved: the Civil War ended, the Thalmor menace
unmasked and largely driven out, and the ideals (both Nordic freedom and Imperial unity) reconciled into a
new, stronger theme: Hope for Tomorrow. The final image in the module might be an illustration of the
PCs standing atop the Throat of the World at sunrise, cloaks fluttering, gazing out over the unified province
they helped forge – a truly cinematic end.
Thus ends the Skyrim Civil War Campaign. The land’s fate is secured, for now, by the players’ hands. The
Game Master is encouraged to continue the story if desired – perhaps segueing into post-war intrigues or
the looming Great War with the Dominion – but as a self-contained saga, this campaign concludes with
Skyrim entering a new era of dawn. The bards sing a final verse:
“From Whiterun’s flames to Solitude’s sun,
Our heroes fought ’til peace was won.
Stormcloak courage and Imperial grace,
Together struck the Aldmeri base.
Talos smiles upon our land,
Freed from hatred, hand in hand.
By fate’s design and heroes’ end,
Skyrim stands, unbroken – to defend.” 13
This is the legacy of the PCs – a legacy that will guide Skyrim when the next storm comes, and one that
turns war’s tragic end into the promise of a united, stronger tomorrow. The final Fate Point is awarded to
each player as the credits roll – for they have truly earned the title “Saviors of Skyrim.”
~ FIN ~
GM Tips and Campaign Retrospective: (below are additional notes for the GM to consider after running the
campaign)
• Player-Driven Outcomes: This module provided numerous branching paths and optional scenes
(like the High Hrothgar peace council) that can drastically alter the tone of the ending. Embrace the
outcome your players steer toward. If they opted for uncompromising victory instead of
reconciliation, frame the ending accordingly – perhaps a harsher but stable regime, and note that
Consequences (like lingering rebel sympathies or embittered populaces) may persist as aspects into
future play. Conversely, if they somehow brokered peace without a final battle, let that stand as their
triumph (maybe Ulfric and Elisif forming a joint moot because of the PCs) – a rarer outcome but
within Fate’s flexibility. Every ending should address the campaign’s core conflicts as resolved, one
way or another, to feel satisfying.
37
• Integrating Fate Mechanics in Final Sessions: In the climactic scenes, many aspects were in play –
encourage players to use their Fate Points to invoke those cinematic details. For example, in the final
duel, a player could invoke Ulfric’s “Thalmor’s Unwitting Pawn” aspect (exposed in his dossier) to
hit him with an emotional argument instead of a sword – possibly taking him out of the conflict by
compelling surrender rather than dealing a killing blow. Likewise, the final battle clocks (like the
Thalmor’s assassination countdown) can be represented physically on paper for players to see,
heightening tension (“3 boxes left until Elenwen reaches Ulfric – what do you do?!”). The players’
quick thinking and use of Create Advantage actions (like rigging a bridge to collapse or rallying
troops with a rousing speech) should be encouraged and rewarded, as these can dramatically swing
the large-scale conflict in Fate’s narrative system.
• NPC Fate Point Uses: Remember that major NPCs (Ulfric, Tullius, etc.) have their own pools to
spend. You demonstrated this when Ulfric perhaps invoked “The Sons of Skyrim are my strength”
to boost his troops or when Tullius compelled “By the Book” on himself to initially insist on Ulfric’s
execution. In the final sessions, using these NPC Fate actions lets the players feel the weight of these
legendary figures, but by Act IV the players likely have more Fate Points and narrative control –
appropriately, as the climax is their story to finish.
• Aftermath and Sequel Hooks: The module leaves room for further adventures. If a campaign were
to continue, you could carry forward unresolved threads as aspects on the world. For instance,
“Unfinished Business of the Thalmor” could be an aspect signaling that while Thalmor influence is
curbed, agents still lurk (the PCs might hunt them down in a sequel). “Skyrim Reborn, But…” might
denote an issue like economic strain or a resurgence of dragons (if running concurrently with the
Dragonborn’s timeline) – giving a new storyline. Provide Fate Points to players when these world
aspects complicate their peacetime life (e.g., a compel that a Thalmor assassin seeks revenge on a
PC dignitary, dragging them into a cloak-and-dagger duel in the new court).
• Character Advancement: By campaign’s end, consider allowing players to rewrite one of their
aspects or swap a stunt to reflect their growth. Perhaps a PC’s “Vindictive Patriot” trouble no longer
applies after they learned mercy – they might change it to “Protective Patriot” or an entirely
different trouble like “Burdened by Expectations of Leadership” if they took on a ruling role. This
solidifies the campaign’s long-term impact on their personal identities.
The Skyrim Civil War Fate Campaign is now concluded, with the players having authored a new chapter in
Elder Scrolls lore through collaborative storytelling and Fate Core’s dynamic mechanics. As a Game Master,
take a moment to commend the group: they navigated complex plots of war, intrigue, and moral choice,
and emerged not just as stronger characters but as part of Skyrim’s living history. In the end, the world of
Tamriel is a little changed by their deeds – and should any dark clouds gather again on the horizon
(whether Daedric princes scheming or the drums of the Dominion’s armies), the heroes of this saga stand
ready, fate tokens in hand, to face whatever comes with courage and honor.
End of Campaign Module.
