World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth – Fate Core
Campaign Module (Part 2)
Additional NPC Profiles (Alliance)
King Genn Greymane (Alliance). As King of Gilneas, Genn is fiercely protective of his people and obsessed
with vengeance against the Horde. He vowed to make the Horde pay for burning Teldrassil. Genn’s
motivation is to defend Gilneas and honor his fallen, hoping to prevent another tragedy. He fears losing
his people again (as he once lost them to the worgen curse) and repeating past mistakes. Personality-
wise, Genn is stubborn, proud, and ruthless in retribution, yet capable of compassion (e.g. sparing
imprisoned Troll captives and later sparing Talanji’s life). He is haunted by guilt (fear of failing his duty) and
fiercely loyal to his allies. 
Aspects (examples): “King of Gilneas, Vowed to Avenge Teldrassil”, “Reluctant Refuge for Darkshore”, “Shadow of
the Gilnean Wall”. Stunts (examples): Gilnean Blade (once per scene, +2 on an attack vs. Undead or beasts as
his silver-edged sword strikes true), Howling Wolf’s Grace (free invoke to create a wolf ally or distraction,
reflecting Gilnean pride). Roleplay: Softens for his son or militia, growls about “Horde dogs,” and often
broods on losses. 
Wrathion, Black Prince (Alliance–Bastion of Balance). Wrathion is a cunning black dragon hatchling
who strives to protect Azeroth by any means. He believes the war’s outcome must serve the greater
good; thus his motivation is preserving Azeroth’s future even if it means allying with unlikely forces. He
hopes to avert apocalyptic futures he foresaw, and fears the world’s destruction or failure of his vision.
Wrathion is ruthless, calculating and single-minded – he “pursues what he perceives as the greater good
with almost fanatical devotion”. His personality is proud and enigmatic, and he sees mortality as a
weakness. 
Aspects: “Ominous Fate-Seer of Azeroth”, “Harbinger of the Dragonflight”, “Wielder of Futuristic Power”. Stunts:
Dragon’s Insight (may spend a Fate Point to gain a 5-minute prescient view of the battlefield, granting +2
on any single Conflict roll), Legendary Arsenal (possesses an Azerite-imbued cloak; once per session,
invoke its aspect for +2 when defending or attacking). Roleplay: Speaks with quiet confidence; uses
foreboding metaphors. He will challenge any tactic that might threaten the world. 
Ranger-General Vereesa Windrunner (Alliance). Vereesa is Sylvanas’s sister and a high elf ranger who
fights to protect Azeroth and her Horde-allied kinsmen. Her motivation is to end Sylvanas’s tyranny
for the greater good. She hopes for Horde-Alliance unity against common enemies, fearing both the
Horde’s ruin under Sylvanas and the spread of evil (Old Gods). Vereesa is bold, diplomatic, and idealistic.
In BfA she sided with Horde dissidents and the Alliance to depose Sylvanas. She values family and duty,
and will bridge factions. 
Aspects: “Ranger-General of the Silver Covenant”, “Sylvanas’s Kin on the Council”, “Champion of Undivided
Azeroth”. Stunts: Sharpshooter (+2 on any long-range or hidden target attack), Banner of Hope (free invoke1

to create an advantage “Rally of the Windrunners” that grants all allies +2 on their next roll, representing
inspiring leadership). Roleplay: Speaks earnestly and encourages unity, but can be ruthless toward true
enemies. She’ll press PCs to consider the bigger picture beyond faction pride. 
Additional NPC Profiles (Horde)
Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix (Horde – Goblins). Gallywix is the greedy Trade Prince of the Bilgewater
Cartel, who finances the Horde’s war effort. He seeks profit and personal power above all; his
motivation is wealth and influence, his hope to amass ever greater riches, and his fear of losing status or
being cheated. Gallywix is cunning, opportunistic, and utterly mercenary. He “funds the Horde’s war
campaign and understands Azerite better than any”, but he laughs off the human cost: upon
reflection he mused that if he’d never revealed Azerite to Sylvanas, perhaps the Fourth War wouldn’t have
happened – then admitted “he doesn’t actually care”. He is unscrupulous, backstabs even allies for gain,
yet outwardly jovial and oily. 
Aspects: “Trade Prince of Bilgewater”, “Nothing is Free, Only Deals”, “Azerite Tech Baron”. Stunts: Boomsuit
Tactics (once per scene, deploys his Azerite-armor mech to gain +2 on a physical attack); Bargain Binder
(free invoke to add an aspect like “Haunted Contract” on an NPC or item, forcing a compel or extra cost on a
foe by invoking a hidden clause). Roleplay: Speaks flamboyantly about profit, constantly negotiates deals
even mid-battle, and always has a hidden agenda. He may abandon allies if a better payout arises. 
Queen Regent Talanji (Horde – Zandalari). Talanji is the young Queen of Zandalar (daughter of Rastakhan)
and priestess of Rezan. She deeply cares for her people and kingdom, uniting Zandalari traditions
with a new world view. Her motivation is protecting Zandalar’s future and her Loa, with hope of true glory
for her empire under the Horde. She is compassionate, but duty-bound; she does not think the old ways
are always best and supported the Horde alliance even against her own advisers. Talanji fears
betrayal (by her people or Sylvanas) and the destruction of her homeland. Her personality is dignified,
earnest, and courageous (she even led an army into Nazmir to fight blood trolls). 
Aspects: “Queen Regent of the Zandalari Empire”, “Priestess of Rezan”, “Legacy of the Loa”. Stunts: Rezan’s
Blessing (invokes an aspect “Blessing of Rezan” to heal a consequence or boost an ally once per session),
Dragonflight Strike (+2 on a spear attack when an ally just fell or is wounded, channeling Rezan’s fury).
Roleplay: Speaks with royal authority yet genuine warmth. She sympathizes with orphans and slaves
(especially trolls), and will support any PC who fights for Zandalari honor. If betrayed, she grieves deeply but
can become fiercely vengeful. 
Overlord Geya’rah (Horde – Mag’har Orcs). Geya’rah is the feral Mag’har Orc Overlord (daughter of
alternate Durotan and Draka). She is driven by honor and strength. Her motivation is to see a Horde of
strength and honor, hoping to forge a proud future for her orcs. She fears weakness and cowardice; she
admired Saurfang’s self-sacrifice and now rejects Sylvanas’s self-serving rule. Geya’rah is stern, martial,
and unyielding: in BfA she stayed loyal to Sylvanas to the end, then renounced Sylvanas once Saurfang fell.
She is pragmatic but traditional, seeing the Horde as family. 
Aspects: “Mag’har Warchief of Honor”, “Veteran of Draenor”, “Clan Firerunner”. Stunts: Orc Fury (+2 to damage
or spirit for one scene after defending a Warchief or compatriot), March of War (free create the advantage
“Overlord’s Rally” once per session, giving Horde allies +2 on next Conflict roll by her leadership). Roleplay:4

Speaks bluntly, often quoting elders. She will challenge PCs to be honorable and might spurn tactics she
deems cowardly. She might even physically punish weakness. 
Ambassador Zekhan (Horde – Zandalari Troll). Zekhan is a young jungle troll shaman who idolizes Varok
Saurfang and the Horde’s old ideals. His motivation is restoring the Horde’s honor. He witnessed
Saurfang’s revolution and took it to heart, vowing to live up to Saurfang’s sacrifice. Zekhan hopes to
unite Troll and Orc traditions in peace; he fears the Horde fracturing and Sylvanas corrupting it. He is
optimistic, garrulous and good-hearted, often cheerful even amid war. Zekhan is loyal to friends and
keeps morale up (he told orphans tales of Saurfang). 
Aspects: “Zandalari Envoy of the Horde”, “Saurfang’s Hopeful Disciple”, “Stormcaller Shaman”. Stunts: Lightning
Reflexes (+2 to Athletics or Quickness rolls when reacting to danger, as the Loa blesses him), Spirit Totem
(free invoke: place an aspect “Ancient Loa’s Protection” for one scene, granting Horde allies +2 to resist
supernatural attacks). Roleplay: Speaks excitedly about heroes, often with a grin. He may babble or joke to
defuse tension. If the PCs doubt, he will earnestly remind them of Saurfang’s creed. He will willingly sacrifice
himself for others, making his survival unclear in crisis. 
Mini-Campaigns by Act and Faction
Act I – War of the Thorns (Burning of Teldrassil)
Alliance Assaults:
- Raid on Durotar: In the aftermath of Teldrassil’s burning, the Alliance considers a bold counterstrike on
Horde homelands. Led by King Genn Greymane (with Anduin and Jaina’s blessing), PCs can lead an
expedition into Durotar, striking at Scarab Flat or even Orgrimmar. Scenes: storming Echo Isles,
sabotaging Horde ships at Bilgewater Harbor, or negotiating with Horde loyalists like druid Malfurion or
even disaffected trolls like Thrall’s spirit. Consequences hinge on strategy: a swift assault may force Sylvanas
to divert forces from Gilneas, while delays could let Horde reinforcements arrive. PC choices matter: If
players adopt stealth (sneak into Splintertree) they might avoid open battle but risk leaving key flanks
undefended. If they recruit Wrathion’s arcane support, they gain an advantage vs. Horde warlocks. Possible
NPC outcomes: Genn might fall in battle if PCs push recklessly, or he may doubt PCs’ loyalty if they disobey
(forcing a roll to keep him from storming off). Rewards: Success grants +2 Stormwind Alliance Favor and a
stolen Azerite relic (an “Orc’s Demise Axe” extra: +2 vs. Orcs). Failure yields a Consequence Aspect like
“Bound for Orgrimmar Cell” (for PCs who are captured). 
Defense of Ashenvale: Simultaneously, Horde forces have moved into Ashenvale’s fringes. Alliance
PCs can join General Tyrande or Vereesa to repel a troll raid on Astranaar. This 2-session arc
involves skirmishes at Smuggler’s Den and the Battle for Splintertree. Tactical choices (ambush vs.
frontal assault) determine if NPCs live or die (e.g., Ranger-General Velonara may fall). If PCs align
with Rangers, they earn a tracking aspect; if they mishandle negotiations with local Druids, some
villagers may side with trolls. Rewards: Allied Aspect “Heart of the Forest” (+2 nature defense) or a
rare Longbow of Quickshot (+2 on ranged defense) and improved Night Elf reputation.
Horde Assaults:
- Horde Raid on Darkshore: While Teldrassil burned, Horde forces under Nathanos and Sylvanas strike at
Darkshore to eliminate Night Elf resistance. PCs can lead a raid on Azurewatch Isle or Ameth’Aran. Scenes:
pursuing fleeing Gilnean refugees and confronting rugged defenders led by Worgen militia. Player choices9

(brutal assault vs. calculated terror) influence outcome: crushing the Alliance here might sow panic in
Stormwind; mercy might rally more opponents. NPC outcome: if PCs spare Alliance prisoners, General
Eastvale (from stockade) might align with them later. If they execute prisoners, the Horde War Council may
reward them with an Azerite shard (Extra aspect “Beneath Azerite Scepter” ). Rewards: Horde Valor aspect (+2
morale on next battle) or Stun Grenades (stunt granting one-use extra ranged attack).
Siege of Gilneas: Horde advances into Gilneas following Teldrassil’s fall. PCs may join Baine or
Lor’themar to overrun the Alliance port at Ruins of Gilneas. Scenes: street fighting in Gilneas City and
the cannon battle with the Alliance fleet. Choices (ignite fires to flush enemies vs. lure them out) alter
defenses. If PCs do well, Lor’themar offers a Minor Aspect “Honor of the Blood Elves” (for future
invokes). If PCs hesitate, Gilnean worgen Lorna Crowley may appear and drastically alter
negotiations. Rewards include captured Gilneas cannon (Extra: +2 siege attacks) and boosted Horde
reputation with Blood Elves.
Act II – Siege of Lordaeron (Battle for the Undercity)
Alliance Assaults:
- Cutting Off the Plaguelands: As Alliance forces march on Lordaeron, PCs can disrupt Horde plague
supplies. Under Khadgar’s aegis, they raid the Corin’s Crossing laboratory in Eastern Plaguelands to destroy
az’gal techniques. Scenes: sneaking through cursed ghosts and a showdown with Forsaken alchemists.
Tactical choice: sabotage (slowing Horde healers in Tirisfal) vs. capturing samples for Reverse Engineering
(gain an Aspect). NPC risk: Valoren, a Forsaken escapee, could betray Sylvanas if saved; if not rescued,
Horde gets stronger undead resistance. Rewards: the “Censer of Purification” (Azerite censer; +2 cleanse
uses) and Stormwind’s gratitude (Stunt: Light’s Blessing, once/session free heal of minor wound).
Shadowy Ops in Tirisfal: Alliance PCs may infiltrate Lordaeron itself, posing as loyalists to plant
explosives or free Forsaken prisoners (e.g. baby Lilian Voss ). Scenes: court intrigue in the ruins’
council and stealth mission in the Royal Cemetery. Successful choices yield intel on Sylvanas’s plans
(Aspect “Sylvanas’s Weakness” ). Risks: if caught, PC could be branded an enemy, provoking a battle.
NPC: If PCs protect Voss, she becomes a valuable spy for Alliance (granting later leverage with Horde
loyalists). Rewards: unique gear like the “Light of Tirisfal” (stunt: Radiant Strike, once/scene +2 on
first attack) and greater Gilneas Allied status.
Horde Assaults:
- Redridge Uprising: The Horde plans sabotage across the Eastern Kingdoms. PCs may join Nathanos’s
Rangers to instigate chaos in Redridge Mountains (blowing up supply trains or recruiting ogres to attack
Lakeshire). Scenes: ambushes on caravans and parley with Arathi trolls. Outcomes: delaying Alliance
reinforcements speeds up Gilneas’s fall. If PCs free imprisoned Horde saboteurs instead of killing them,
those agents might trigger fear among Lakeshire civilians later. NPC fate: the troll Queen Mia Greymane
(Genn’s daughter) could be taken hostage – either turned into a propaganda figure (Alliance stunt later) or
rescued (earning Horde favor). Rewards: saboteur tools (Free Action for one Conflict to create cover) and a
personal Audience with Sylvanas (advance on Horde Council).
Forsaken Espionage in Duskwood: Sylvanas dispatches PCs to sow discord in Alliance-held
Duskwood. They can impersonate ghostly cultists or employ Dark Ranger Lyana to disrupt the
Alliance war council in Stormwind (taking place offscreen). Choices: assassinate key commanders
(creating an Aspect “Weakened Morale” for PCs) or incite fear by spreading plague rumors. If PCs
misfire, Alliance reinforcements will arrive early (tougher Siege ahead). Roleplay trap: General Karl •

Ravenholdt might confront them; depending on PC diplomacy, he could switch sides or be killed.
Rewards: Darkmoon Faire tickets (stunt: Sleight of Hand, bluff any one roll) or Forsaken Signet
Ring (+2 on infiltration/stealth rolls).
Act III – Warfronts and Blood Campaigns
Alliance Arcs:
- Stormgarde Warfront (Arathi Highlands): PCs join King Anduin and Argent Crusade generals to siege
Stormgarde. Scenes: large-scale battle taking Stromgarde Keep (using Horde siege rules in Fate), storming
the archives for vital intel, then negotiating with dwarven clans. Tactical options: flank via the western caves
(Aspect “Underground Assault” if successful) or frontal night attack (gains darkness advantage). NPC leaders:
Genn Greymane or Wrathion could lead flanking maneuver; failure costs them. After combat, Alliance may
gain new Stunts (e.g. Stormgarde’s Favor, +2 to defense from reinforced shields). 
Liberation of Darkshore: Alliance PCs can liberate Ameth’Aran. Scenes include rescuing Darnassus
refugees at Sapphirepine Lodge, and protecting the World Tree’s remnants while fending off
Forsaken druids. Choice: Escort or escape for Gilnean children vs. hold the line. Outcome variations:
Success secures a new base (Aspect “Amphitheater of Darnassus” for buffs). If Horde PCs are present,
they try to stop the evacuation (potentially capturing a VIP like Magister Dawnspeaker). Rewards:
Access to Magister’s Vault (gear or Frostfire Wand +2 fire frost damage) and +2 Druid faction. 
Stranglethorn Campaign: The Alliance may push into Stranglethorn Vale to counter a Horde
foothold there. PCs help King Rastakhan’s captors or aid neutral factions (like the Naga) against
Bilgewater Cartel thugs. Scenes: jungle skirmishes, jungle defoliation traps, and a showdown at
Zul’Gurub’s ruins. Player choice: side with jungle trolls to sabotage Horde (gains Aspect “Echoes of
Zul”) or forge a pact with Naga (gain a magic trident). NPC involvement: Vereesa or Wrathion
(guiding on ancient traps). Rewards: a Jade Fang Knife (stunt: poison blade +2 to inflict a minor
consequence) and Alliance influence in Darkspear trolls. 
Alliance Assault on Durotar (Alternate): In an uncharted plan, Alliance PCs may launch a surprise
raid from Darkshore boats to assault Orgrimmar’s outskirts as Sylvanas’s forces are stretched thin.
Scenes: night infiltration under storm cover, fighting at Sen’jin Village or the Drag, and an attempt to
spark rebellion in the Orcish Quarter. PC tactics (stealth assassination vs. causing widespread panic)
determine if Warchief’s forces are trapped or alarmed. Possible betrayal: the Horde NPC Thrall (if
alive in vision) might appear to either stop or aid them depending on choices. Outcome: if
Orgrimmar walls fall to an Aspect “Broken Gates”, PCs can claim Horde artifacts. Rewards: Captured
Horde banner (Aspect: “Horde Defiled”, bonus when taunting Horde foes) and Alliance Prestige +3.
Horde Arcs:
- Battle for Zuldazar (Dazar’alor): Horde PCs must defend Zandalar’s capital from the Alliance assault.
Scenes: fighting on the great seal, reinforcing City Guard, and boarding an Alliance sky-ship. NPCs: Baine or
Rastakhan direct the defense (and may die or be captured). Choices: Hold the front gates or launch counter-
attacks in the undercity. Outcome: If the PCs successfully “Break the Alliance”, they gain an Aspect “Heart of
Dazar’alor” (command advantage). If failed, Horde loses a powerful ally (e.g. Queen Azshara’s forces rally• 
•

to Alliance). Rewards: Honorary Zandalari weapon (stunt: Loa-Infused Strike, +2 vs enemies vulnerable to
poison) and increased loyalty from Zandalari NPCs. 
Stormsong Valley Campaign: Horde PCs spearhead the invasion of Kul Tiras to uproot Alliance
bases. Scenes: jungle warfare in Drustvar, naval skirmish at Boralus docks, and negotiating (or
fighting) the loyalist militia. Tactical variation: blockade the harbor (Prevent Alliance Reinforcements)
vs. flank the castle by storming Forward Base. If Horde recruits renegade Kul Tiran mercenaries, they
get an advantage; if Alliance manages a counter-siege of Zandalar, Horde cities weaken. NPCs:
Overlord Geya’rah may lead or back out if honor code is broken. Possible betrayal: PC must fear that
Rokhan (Darkspear) is actually also aiding Sylvanas’s Horde splinter; if tricked, Horde PCs could be
ambushed. Rewards: Captured Azerite generator (granting Azerite Bomb extra: once per session, area
entanglement), and Horde Reputation +2 in Kul Tiras.
Nazmir Expedition: Horde PCs confront the Blood Trolls of G’huun in Nazmir. Scenes: exploring
ancient Zul temples (puzzles with Loa statues), facing blood trolls, and possibly negotiating with
Bwonsamdi for undead aid. PC choices: liberate Bwonsamdi’s followers for a boon (gain Aspect “Void
of the Loa” for mental defense) or destroy them. If PCs awaken G’huun inadvertently, they must fight
him (cataclysmic battle). NPC ally: Talanji or Zekhan might accompany to interpret lores. Outcome:
sealing G’huun grants Horde a Bloodhound mount (Stunt: Sniff Out Weakness, +2 when tracking
Alliance). Failure could unleash a dark consequence (Aspects like “Mark of the Old God” ). 
Horde Raid on Darkshore (Alternate): In a bold countermove, Horde PCs can launch a second
assault to retake Ameth’Aran after Alliance captured it. Scenes: storming Northern Darkshore forts
under moonlight, catching Alliance rebuilders unawares. The attack can be full frontal (ravaging
defenses) or guileful (selling poison to local dryads via agents). Choices affect local night elves (if
they fight on Horde side, Horde gains “Local Guides” advantage; if alliances with Druid friends, many
defend heavily). NPC outcomes: the Horde war-chief Garrosh’s ghost may tempt PCs with power,
possibly betraying Horde strategy. Rewards: Lost Horde treasure chests (loot: Kaldorei’s Bane Axe,
+2 vs. night elves) and Horde War Council approval (Stunt: Horde Warbanner, once/session free +2
aura to allies).
Act IV – The Turning Point (Dazar’alor & Zandalar Assault)
Alliance Assaults:
- Siege of Dazar’alor (Alliance Assault): PCs join Anduin’s forces to conquer Zandalar’s capital. Scenes:
beach landing at Drustvar, storming the docks, and laying siege to Dazar’alor (using Fate’s large-scale
Conflict rules). They can parley with Rastakhan or try to rescue Baine from Sylvanas’s treachery. Tactical
choices: Focus on the Great Seal (to disable city defenses) or sneak into the palace. If PCs capture Rastakhan
instead of killing him, they gain a powerful hostage. If Sylvanas escapes during chaos, she gains an Aspect
“Forsaken Flight” to evade later. Outcomes: A successful capture grants PCs Aspect “Crown of Zandalar” (free
compel on Horde morale). Rewards: Azerite javelin (stunt: Spear of the Loa, once/scene +4 damage to a
key target) and Horde Council leverage (gain an audience with Talanji). 
Alliance Raid on Orgrimmar (Alternate): Simultaneously, an Alliance strike team assaults
Orgrimmar to prevent Horde retaliation. Led by Vereesa or Wrathion, PCs fight through the Drag’s
barricades and seek the Orgrimmar vault. Scenes: climbing siege towers under arrow fire, skyship
skirmish over Valley of Strength, and engaging Warchief’s guards. Choices: Light the war drums to•

•

sow panic (Aspect “Alarms Raised” ) or cut the supply line quietly. NPC twist: If Garrosh (legendary
spirit) appears as an omen, he may push Horde or PC depending on actions. Outcome: If Orgrimmar
holds, Horde releases an Aspect “Iron Resolve” for future rallies. Rewards: Dwarven battle-engine
blueprints (grant Siege Expert stunt: +2 to construct or command siege weapons) and Alliance
prestige with the Kul Tiran navy. 
Stormwind Defense Mission: Alliance PCs are recalled to defend Stormwind in Sylvanas’s
counterstrike on Kul Tiras or direct assault. This 2-session arc includes naval defense of Stormwind
Harbor and repelling Horde dropships onto The Drag. If PCs anticipate the attack (via intel),
Stormwind suffers minimal damage; if surprised, PCs must gather civilians and hold key choke
points (exhausting the city guard). NPC: King Anduin may fight at the front; protecting him yields a
Great Ally (Aspect “For the King!” ). Outcomes vary: a hard defense grants PCs an Aspect “Shieldwall of
Stormwind” (+2 resistance on next danger), failure yields a “Burning Boughs” consequence if the Great
Tree falls. Rewards: Stormwind Knight gear (stunt: Lion’s Charge, once/scene +2 on a bold attack)
and extra Fate Points from the crown.
Horde Assaults:
- Stormwind Siege (Horde Assault): Horde PCs may lead a desperate assault on an Alliance stronghold
(e.g. Stormwind or Ironforge) to force a ceasefire. Scenes: breaching the city walls, battling in the Trade
District, and taking or freeing a Horde VIP prisoner (e.g. Sylvanas’s cloak-bearer). Player tactics (head-on vs.
sabotage) will determine if Alliance forces collapse or reinforcements flood. If Thrall’s spirit rallies
defenders, PCs face a moral choice: kill or spare him (affecting faction morale). Outcome: taking Stormwind
is massive (Aspect “City of Lion’s Pride” for Horde), repelling it boosts Horde unity (Minor Aspect “Defenders of
Orgrimmar” ). Rewards: Dragonscale Shield (+2 defense vs. dragons/unholy) and increased Horde
Commander Rank (+1 rank for each PC). 
Zuldazar Counter-Assault: After Dazar’alor falls, Horde PCs can strike at Alliance positions in
Zandalar. Scenes: raiding Zandalan Villages to free Horde sympathizers, or attacking outlying
reinforcement camps. Choices: target resource caches (slow Alliance advance) or rescue Talanji’s
loyalists (boost Horde morale). If PCs successfully rally the Zanchuli Council’s dissenters, Horde
reclaims influence (Aspect “Blood of the Loa” ). If they fail, Talanji’s rule may stabilise. NPC: If PCs save
Zekhan (ambassador), he pledges future aid; if abandoned, Horde loses trust. Rewards: Stolen Kul
Tiran cannon (Extra: Cannoneer’s Blessing, once/scene area advantage) and Horde glory in
Zandalar.
Nazjatar Defense: As Jaina leads forces to seal Azshara’s power, Horde PCs must defend the home
shores. Scenes: undersea ambushes on Night Elf fleets, fighting naga on the beach, and a final stand
in the Echo Isles temple. Choices: unite with Drustvar’s murlocs (Alliance rival) or confront Xal’atath’s
cultists. NPC involvement: Bwonsamdi’s gamble might manifest (he can aid or bar PCs based on
choices in Act III), adding a wildcard. Success yields the Sundered Heart aspect (free compel
“Azshara’s Madness”), failure gives Azshara a toehold (Dark Aspect “Nightmare Tides” ). Rewards: Loa-
scarred Trident (stunt: Call of the Loa, summon serpent ally for a scene) and Horde unity aspect
(“Vengeance for Dazar’alor”).•

Act V – The Depths of Nazjatar and Azshara’s Assault
Alliance Campaigns:
- Nazjatar Expedition: Alliance PCs join Jaina and Naga allies to hunt for the Pearl of Zin-Azshari, hoping to
control Azshara’s power. Scenes: underwater exploration (Lore rolls to translate Nal’thar symbols),
negotiating with Queen Azshara’s servants or freeing a naga traitor. Tactical choices: split up to cover more
ground (risk splitting forces) vs. stick together against the loas. Outcomes: retrieving the pearl grants PC
Aspect “Pearl of Ancient Kings” (critically turns tide in final fight), losing it yields curse. NPCs: If PCs show
mercy to a naga princess (Azsh’iri), she may become a future ally (or betray later). Rewards: Alliance Pact
scrolls (grant a single-use truce-phase negotiation) and new Icecrown Artifact (stunt: Frostfire Shield, +2
resistance vs fire).
Defense of Orgrimmar: Azshara’s wrath turns on Azeroth – Alliance PCs return to help Stormwind or
Ironforge against her army. Scenes: fighting legionaires in the streets, rallying wounded defenders,
and seeking the shrine of Elune in Stormwind Keep for a beacon. If PCs reach the shrine in time
(Athletics/Lore contest), they invoke an ally aspect “Blessing of Elune” to rally all. Failing that,
Orgrimmar/Azeroth city parts burn (stunt loss). Rewards: Azerothian Blessing (+1 to all future rolls
from city guard support) or Helm of the Protector (+2 to one defensive block). 
Horde Campaigns:
- Last Stand in Dazar’alor: As Azshara’s minions attack Boralus, Horde PCs must finalize control of Zandalar.
Scenes: breaking the siege of Krag’wa’s temple (earning the Loa frog’s aid) and hunting for the hidden ritual
that summons N’Zoth’s fragment. Choices: slaughter Azshara’s worshippers (intimidation gains Aspect “Lost
Faith”) or attempt negotiation via Bwonsamdi’s bridge (gain undead allies). Success: stop Azshara gives
Horde Aspect “Warden of the Deep” (command sea creatures). If Azshara breaches the Tomb, Horde gets
“Eldritch Curse”. NPC fate: If Thrall appeared, he might challenge PCs to a duel (up to GM discretion).
Rewards: Fishbone Spear (stunt: Sea Lord’s Wrath, once/scene summon sharks) and final Horde war chest
containing a Legendary Azerite relic (granting a major new stunt chosen by PCs). 
Azshara’s Assault: Horde PCs join Zul’s forces to repel the sea witch’s invasion. Scenes: defending
the Zalamar expedition site, escorting Rastari refugees on ships, and finally facing Lady Ashvane’s
pirate fleet turned Azsharan. Tactical: sink ships before they land (Athletics to aim, Lore to exploit
weak spots), or fight on shore. Possible betrayal: if PCs allied with Ashvane or freed her earlier, she
might turn against Azshara’s forces as promised. Outcomes: a victorious Horde gains Aspect 
“Zandalar Unbroken”, defeat yields “Broken Treaty” compels in future diplomacy. Rewards: Battle-
Jagged Cutlass (+2 parry for one scene) and respect from Zandalar (access to the Keeper’s Favor
stunt, once/scene revive a minor NPC).
Each mini-campaign above is a 2–4 session arc. PCs choose which to undertake (faction allegiance guides
options) and each path has branching outcomes. For example, in Stormgarde, choosing a night attack
grants surprise (advantage) but increases heat (triggering a larger final boss fight), whereas negotiating
with the gnome Gelbin Mekkatorque (possible in the Arathi campaign) could avoid major conflict altogether.
Named NPCs react dynamically: Vereesa might betray a pact if you turn on her sister’s memory, and Talanji
might bow out if honor is compromised. Each success rewards boons (Stunts like “Horde’s Last Stand” or gear
such as Azerite weapons), while failures impose Fate Consequences (e.g. “Cursed by the Loa” ). All scenarios
remain focused on Horde vs. Alliance – for instance, any troll or goblin given is as Horde, and any Kul Tiran
or Darnassian as Alliance. •

Player Choice and Consequences: At each stage, players decide which assault to support. For example, if
Alliance PCs choose Durotar over Ashenvale, Horde takes Ashenvale unopposed. If Horde PCs opt for
Darkshore instead of Gilneas, Gilneas falls to Alliance easily. Tactics matter: stealth incurs stealthy
consequences (ambushing saves Fate Points, frontal assaults risk more complications). NPC fates depend
on PCs: an injured Gallywix might be killed by PCs in Zuldazar (locking out his favors) or survive to give
future Horde bonuses. Betrayals can occur: refusing to free a captive Talanji in Stormwind might mean no
Loa aid later. Each mini-campaign’s conclusion grants tangible rewards – new Stunts (extra abilities), Azerite
gear (Extras with aspects), or reputation boosts (faction leverage like “Trusted by Zandalar” ). These
mechanical benefits carry forward: e.g. a saved ally might award an extra Fate Point during a future assault.
All the above content expands on Part I’s outline, fleshing out the “Mini-Campaigns” and assault options for each
Act (I–V) of the BfA Fate module. NPC profiles and Fate stats are consistent with Part I’s style, providing
motivations, aspects, and stunts for leading characters. These expansions strictly concern Alliance vs. Horde
conflicts and explore alternate outcomes (such as an Alliance strike on Durotar or Horde seizing Darkshore) to
enrich the war narrative.
