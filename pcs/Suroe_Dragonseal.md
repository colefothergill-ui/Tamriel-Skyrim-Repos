## Stunts (5)

### Flow Like Water — Redirecting Spiral
When you **Defend** against a **melee** attack using **Athletics** (you must have room to move—no pin/grapple/fully boxed), gain **+2** to the defense roll.
If you **succeed with style**, you may redirect the attacker’s force onto **another enemy in the same zone**: that enemy takes up to **2 shifts** of physical stress (they may defend normally if the fiction allows). If no second target exists, take the normal Boost instead.

### Sha’do-Pan Parkour
Once per exchange, when terrain makes it plausible (roots, ruins, walls, branches, rooftops), you may **move up to 2 zones** instead of 1 and/or reach **high ground** as part of movement **without an Overcome roll**.
If the route is genuinely blocked (sealed gate, sheer surface, hostile ward), you may attempt it by **Overcoming with Athletics**.
If you end in a clearly advantageous position, gain a **Boost** (e.g., High Ground, Perfect Angle, Vanished Into the Canopy).

### Mana-Quenching Palm
**Once per scene**, when you would deal physical stress with a **Fight Attack**, you may instead **forgo the stress** to **Create an Advantage** on that target: **Drained / Interrupted Casting** with **one free invoke**.
(Works on active casters, enchanted fighters, or anyone strongly “perfumed” with spellwork.)

### Serpent Stance (Toggle) — replaces Breath of Yu’lon
At the start of your turn, you may enter or drop Serpent Stance (no action).

While Serpent Stance is active, once per exchange you may do ONE of the following:
- Gain +2 to Defend with Athletics against a ranged attack you can perceive (arrows, thrown weapons, bolts, etc.), OR
- Gain +2 to Create an Advantage with Notice or Stealth when you’re using misdirection, footwork, and angle-play (feints, vanishing lines, baiting shots, canopy movement, fog play).

If you succeed with style on a defense using Serpent Stance, you also gain a Boost: Venomous Opening (1 free invoke).

### Flurry of Blows
Once per exchange, you may make a **Fight Attack** against multiple enemies in your zone:
- Choose up to **3 targets** in your zone.
- **Roll Fight once.**
- Each target defends separately.
- The 2nd and 3rd targets get **+1** to their defense rolls (split focus).

## Extra: Dracon’Thor’reth — Seal Charge Track
**Seal Charges (current 0/5):** ☐1 ☐2 ☐3 ☐4 ☐5 (max 5)

### Gaining Charges (examples)
Gain +1 Charge when:
- You accept a compel tied to the Seal (and gain the FP as normal),
- You fight in heavy spell-saturation and don’t disengage,
- You choose dominance over mercy in a moment you could have de-escalated,
- You take stress (pain “answers” the seal).

### Techniques (Charge Spend)
- **Dragon-Fury Guard (1–2 Charges):** +2 to a defense; at 2 Charges also creates OFF-BALANCE/SHOOK with 1 free invoke on success.
- **Sun-Dragon Breaker (2–3 Charges):** grants Weapon:2; at 3 Charges also creates CHANNELS SEVERED / WIND KNOCKED OUT with 1 free invoke (in addition to damage).

## Loot/Trophy Extra: Warden-Captain’s Moonsteel Crescent
**Item Aspect:** Moonsteel Crescent of the Wardens  
**Item Trouble:** Recognizable Trophy (Bounty Magnet)

- **Weapon:1** normally
- **Weapon:2** vs targets actively benefiting from wards/druidic terrain magic/ritual geometry/anti-chi lattice

**Ward-Shear:** +2 to Overcome or Create Advantage with Fight when cutting through roots/snares/ward-circles/bindings.  
**Hook-and-Drop:** once per exchange, on succeed with style with the Crescent, create HOOKED AND OFF-BALANCE with 1 free invoke instead of a boost.  
**Proof:** presenting the Crescent creates WARDEN DOWN — PHYSICAL PROOF with 1 free invoke (scene/debrief).
