## Aspects (with descriptors)

### High Concept — Greybeard Disciple Turned Lycanthrope of Hircine
Once a trainee of High Hrothgar’s Greybeards, Oskern followed Jurgen Windcaller’s Way of the Voice, meant to use the Thu’um only in reverence: “solely for the worship and glory of the gods, not the glory of men.”
After a monster slew his family, he vowed vengeance and forged his family’s silver into steel. He hunted the beast beneath Falkreath’s full moon—only to be scarred and afflicted by the very curse he despised. When Kyne did not save him, Oskern embraced the doctrine of Hircine: the Hunt is truth, weakness is sin, and survival is earned.

### Trouble — He Who Heeds the Call of Hircine
Oskern treats beastblood not as shame, but as a proving-ground. Hircine’s doctrine demands strength; there can be no weak links in the pack. Yet the scent of prey, the chaos of war, and moonlit nights can fray his control—turning victory into frenzy. His struggle is not to deny the Beast… but to master it without becoming mindless.

### Silver Sword of Hircine’s Hunt
**Silon Yol** — forged of purified silver: deadly to monsters and monster-hunters, and *twice as deadly to Oskern.* It is a cruel banner of triumph and restraint: “Behold prey—this blade is death to you, and death to me, and yet I have overcome it.” The sword is weapon, vow, and constant reminder that mastery has a price.

### Echoes of the Past — The Way of the Voice
Oskern’s Greybeard training remains a scar of discipline and reverence. The Voice grants calm, authority, and the old spiritual weight of High Hrothgar—but using it for war violates what he once swore, stirring guilt and conflict between old faith and new Hunt-doctrine. Those who recognize his training may demand a higher standard… or try to use him as a symbol.

### Frost Wolf of Falkreath Hold (The Vow)
Once noble-born, Oskern abandoned wealth to become a monk—then returned forged by grief and fury. He believes Falkreath’s rot, especially Siddgeir’s corruption, helped set the stage for his family’s death. He vows to restore Falkreath’s forests and freedoms, champions Ulfric as the true High King, and believes surviving Helgen (and the war’s omens) proves Fate has chosen a side.

## Stunts

### Silon Yol (Silver Fire) — Blade of Hircine
Because your sword is purified silver and you hunt worthy prey, gain **+2 to Fight** when attacking:
- undead, vampires, lycanthropes, and monster-hunters
- or anyone established in-fiction as **worthy prey** for the Hunt.

### Feral Intimidation
Because the beast rides close to the surface, gain **+2 to Provoke** when using wolfish menace (eyes, growl, predatory stillness) to frighten or dominate.

### Supernatural Strength
Because beastblood surges through you even in man-shape, gain **+2 to Physique** when performing **raw feats of force** (breaking doors, lifting/throwing heavy things, grappling, bursting a line, ripping restraints, etc.).  
*(This is “feats,” not every Physique use.)*

**In Beast Form:**
- +2 Physique
- +2 Fight

### Extra — Thu’um (Complete Shout): FUS RO DAH
**Known Shout:** **FUS RO DAH (Unrelenting Force)**  
Typical use: Create an Advantage (**Staggered / Blasted Off Their Feet**), Overcome (clear a path / break formation), rarely Attack (only if using it to harm).

**Recharge: Voice Strain (3 boxes)**
- Mark **1 Strain** when using **FUS RO DAH**
- Mark **2 Strain** if affecting a group / huge target / major obstacle
- At **3 Strain**, you cannot Shout again until you clear at least 1 Strain (rest + centering; often an Overcome with Will)

**Failure clause (not Dragonborn):**
