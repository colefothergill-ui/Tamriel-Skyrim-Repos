# MASTER KEY — BFA (Fate Core)

This is your **living canon index**. Keep it short, clear, and always up to date.

## Tone & Themes
- Epic war story with moral ambiguity, comradeship, and romance beats.
- Consequences matter; victories cost something.

## Mechanical Pillars
- Aspects drive story (scene, faction, NPC, PC).
- Compels are the “war pressure” dial.
- Rewards: Fate Points, temporary boons, new Aspects/Extras.

## Canon Storage Rules
- **Numbers live in `clocks/bfa_clocks.json`** (single source of truth).
- Chapters live in `/volumes/`; session summaries in `/logs/`.
- NPC/PC dossiers live in `/npcs/` and `/pcs/`.

## Reference Docs

## HOUSE RULES — BFA TABLE

### Skills: Columns (NOT the Pyramid)
We do **not** enforce the Fate skill pyramid in this campaign. Skills are treated as **Columns**:
- Keep the current campaign **skill cap** (currently +4 unless later raised by a Major Milestone).
- At milestones, you may increase a skill by **+1** (up to the cap) without needing to “swap down” other skills to maintain a pyramid shape.
- All other milestone rules remain unchanged unless explicitly overridden here.
