# Fate System Toolkit — Options Menu (for this campaign)

> Summary/notes only — use your PDF for full text.

## Why this file exists
The Toolkit is a buffet. This page lists which optional subsystems we’re using (and where to look for them).

## Allowed optional modules (recommended for this campaign)
### Conditions (instead of / alongside stress)
Use named condition tracks like:
- **Wounded**, **Shaken**, **Exhausted**, **Corrupted**, etc.
Each has boxes; checking them has defined effects.

### Countdown / Progress clocks
Use clocks for:
- warfront momentum, morale, infiltration, trust, “a ritual completes,” etc.

### Scale (when armies/dragons show up)
Use a scale ladder to represent overwhelming advantage.
High scale can:
- add bonuses
- reduce harm taken
- or limit what can affect what

### Extras (artifacts, armor, titles, organizations)
Extras are “things with rules”: spellbreaker armor, mage quarters mansion, etc.

## Banned optional modules (to keep play smooth)
- Anything that replaces Fate Points entirely
- Overly granular equipment simulations
- Rules that turn every scene into long tactical mini-games

## House defaults
- We keep the core four actions.
- We use clocks for war + relationships.
- We prefer *success with cost* over dead ends.
