# Fate Core — Quick Reference (table-ready)

> This is a *play aid* and summary. It is **not** a copy of the Fate Core book.

## Dice: 4dF (Fate dice)
Roll four Fate dice (each die is **-**, **0**, or **+**) and add them up:
- Total range: **-4 to +4**
- Your final result = **Skill** + **Roll** + bonuses

## The Four Actions
- **Overcome**: solve a problem / remove an obstacle
- **Create an Advantage**: make a helpful situation aspect, discover info, set someone up
- **Attack**: try to harm or take someone out
- **Defend**: prevent an action or reduce harm

## Outcomes (after comparing totals)
- **Succeed with Style**: you win by 3+ (often gain a *boost* or extra benefit)
- **Succeed**: you win by 1–2
- **Tie**: you get a minor success or success-at-a-cost (context dependent)
- **Fail**: you don’t get what you want (or succeed at a serious cost)

## Aspects (the game’s “truth tags”)
Aspects are short phrases that are true and matter.
- **Invoke** an aspect: spend **1 Fate Point** for **+2** or a reroll (or use a free invoke)
- **Compel** an aspect: accept trouble and gain **1 Fate Point**
- **Free invokes**: created by Create an Advantage, some stunts, and some scene setup

## Boosts
A boost is a *temporary* aspect (usually one free invoke) that disappears after use.

## Stress & Consequences (harm model)
- Stress boxes absorb hits *briefly*
- Consequences are lingering injuries/complications that become aspects:
  - **Mild / Moderate / Severe** (and sometimes **Extreme** in some tables)

## Conflicts, Contests, Challenges (scene structures)
- **Conflict**: back-and-forth action with stress/consequences (fights, chases, debates)
- **Contest**: who wins a goal over several exchanges (races, arguments, pursuits)
- **Challenge**: a series of different obstacles/rolls (heist steps, rituals, investigations)

## Fate Point economy (the “gas tank”)
- Spend to invoke aspects, power some stunts, declare details (if allowed)
- Earn from compels, conceding, and GM awards for play

## Concession vs Taken Out
- **Concede**: you lose on *your terms* and usually earn Fate Points
- **Taken Out**: opponent decides what happens (within reason)

## GM habit: keep it cinematic
Default to:
- *Success with a cost* instead of “nothing happens”
- Consequences that create new story hooks, not just “HP loss”
