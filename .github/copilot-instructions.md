# Copilot Instructions — Tamriel / Skyrim Fate Core Campaign Vault

You are working in a campaign-vault repository. DO NOT restructure the folder tree.
DO NOT delete or overwrite unrelated files. Only touch files explicitly listed in the task.

## Goal
Decontextualize this repo from WoW/BFA into Elder Scrolls: Skyrim (4E 201) Fate Core.
Use the supplied PDFs as the canon source to generate Markdown modules and faction packs.

## Hard rules
- Keep /fate-core/ and /rules/ content intact unless explicitly told to change it.
- Remove WoW/BFA references throughout the repo (file names and text).
- Remove all references to the PC "Suroe Dragonseal" and remove their files.
- Avoid hallucinating details from the PDFs. If you can’t confirm from the PDF text, add TODO markers.

## Output style
- Markdown with clear headings and bullet points for mechanics.
- Fate Core mechanics: aspects, compels, stunts, extras, clocks.
- JSON must remain valid and stable keys should not be renamed unless requested.
