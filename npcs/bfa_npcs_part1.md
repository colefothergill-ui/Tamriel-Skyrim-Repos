World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth – Personal
Quest Catalogue (Fate Core NPCs)
Overview: This catalogue details personal questlines for major NPCs in the Battle for Azeroth Fate Core
campaign (Parts I & II). Each NPC’s profile includes Fate Accelerated Edition stat blocks and relationship arcs
(trust quests, bonding/mentorship, optional romance, and branching outcomes). These quests are
embedded chronologically into the campaign’s Acts, with GM notes on how PCs might encounter or
influence each NPC. Rewards are given as Fate-compatible stunts, items, mounts, or boons, preserving
WoW’s lore while maintaining game balance. NPCs who are in established relationships have no romance
arc (or only platonic arcs), whereas those with ambiguous status may develop romance with a PC under the
right circumstances. GM guidance is provided for divergent outcomes (trust, love, rivalry, betrayal) to
encourage deep, long-term bonds between PCs and these characters. Use these questlines to enrich the
core BfA narrative with personal, emotional journeys alongside each NPC.
King Genn Greymane (Alliance)
Psychological Profile: Genn is the aging worgen King of Gilneas – fiercely protective of his people and
consumed by a desire for vengeance. He “vowed to make the Horde pay for burning Teldrassil,” blaming
Sylvanas for that genocide and for the loss of his son Liam. Stubborn and proud, Genn can be ruthlessly
vengeful (especially toward Sylvanas and the Horde) yet still shows compassion for innocents (he will spare
captives and aid refugees when possible). His deepest fear is losing his people a second time – having
already lost Gilneas to the Curse and civil war – and he is haunted by guilt over Liam’s death. Genn is wise
and loyal to his allies, but grief and rage sometimes make his leadership volatile. He struggles to rein in his
feral worgen wrath, though he channels it at the Horde to fuel his fighting spirit. Beneath the fury, he
remains a devoted father (to Tess) and a stalwart guardian of the Alliance.
Fate Core Stat Sheet: - Aspects: High Concept: “King of Gilneas, Vowed to Avenge Teldrassil.” Trouble:
“Shadow of the Gilnean Wall” (haunted by past losses). Other: “Reluctant Refuge for Darkshore” (sheltering
Night Elf survivors) and “Old Wolf, Loyal to the End.” These capture Genn’s dual nature as a ruler and a
worgen, his vendetta, and his steadfast loyalty.
- Approaches: Forceful +4, Quick +3, Careful +2, Clever +2, Flashy +1, Sneaky +0 (reflecting his brutal, head-
on fighting style and wolfen speed in battle).
- Stunts: Gilnean Blade – Once per scene, Genn gains +2 on a Forceful attack against Undead or beasts (his
silver-edged heirloom blade is lethal to these foes). Howling Wolf’s Grace – Genn can Flashily create an
advantage by howling, invoking Gilnean pride or fear; once per session this grants an ally a free invoke on
an aspect like “Heart of the Pack.” Worgen Fury – (Custom) If Genn has taken harm or is enraged by an
enemy’s taunts, he can Forcefully attack with +2 using his claws and fangs (unleashing his inner beast).
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 4, Mental 3. Consequence slots: Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6).
Trust-Building Questline: Genn’s trust must be earned through loyalty and service to Gilneas and the
Alliance. Key milestones (segments in a “Trust clock”) include:
1. Defend Gilnean Refugees (Act I): During the War of Thorns evacuation of Darkshore, the PC leads a
1

squad to protect fleeing Gilneans from Horde attackers. By ensuring innocents escape the burning of
Teldrassil, the PC proves they value Gilnean lives as Genn does.
2. Recover Liam’s Keepsake (Act II, early war campaign): The PC undertakes a quest to retrieve a
treasured item belonging to Genn’s late son Liam – for example, Liam’s silver pendant lost in a Forsaken-
controlled ruin. This act of compassion and remembrance deeply moves Genn, showing the PC understands
his pain.
3. Hold the Wall: In a desperate battle at the Greymane Wall at dusk, the PC fights back-to-back with Genn.
If the PC shows both ferocity and mercy (such as sparing a defenseless enemy or protecting captured
civilians even amid the fury), Genn notes the balance of duty and honor the PC displays. 
When the Trust clock fills, Genn grants the PC personal respect and responsibility. He might formally
welcome the PC into the Royal Gilnean Guard or entrust them with a critical mission carrying his seal (e.g.
delivering an ultimatum to Sylvanas on his behalf ). Reward: The PC gains an Aspect “Anointed by
the Gilnean King” – invokable for +2 when rallying Gilnean forces or calling in Alliance support (reflecting
Genn’s public endorsement). Genn may also grant a one-time Fate Point to the PC when they take bold
action to defend Gilneas or avenge Teldrassil in the story.
Bonding Arc (Mentorship & Training): Once the PC earns Genn’s trust, he can mentor them in wilderness
survival, leadership under duress, and harnessing one’s inner beast (if the PC is cursed or similarly
burdened). Notable scenes:
- Wolf’s Howl Patrol: Genn invites the PC on a nocturnal patrol through Gilnean forests. Under the
moonlight, he teaches the PC to embrace fear rather than flee it. Mechanic: Once per scenario, Genn can
Flashily assist the PC in resisting fear or panic by invoking “Driven by the Pack’s Howl” – granting +2 to the
PC’s Courage/Will roll to resist terror. This reflects Genn’s presence steadying the PC’s nerves with the
unyielding spirit of the pack.
- Blade Training: In an empty Gilnean courtyard, Genn spars with the PC at dawn, drilling swordplay
techniques he once taught Liam. The PC learns to fight with calculated ferocity. Reward: The PC gains a new
stunt, “Gilnean Steel”, representing this training – once per conflict, the PC may add +2 to a melee attack
Forcefully when using a Gilnean-forged weapon.
- Leadership Counsel: By a campfire after a hard-won battle, Genn discusses strategy, loss, and the weight
of the crown with the PC. He shares how he carries on for his people despite tragedy. Mechanic: The PC
gains a situational boost (one-time +2) when rallying Gilnean or Night Elf allies in a later scene, reflecting
Genn’s personal endorsement giving their words weight. (For example, if the PC gives a speech to
motivate refugees or soldiers, Genn’s backing lets them invoke “Mentored by Greymane’s Resolve” for a
free +2.)
Romance Arc: None. Genn’s love for his late wife Mia (and his enduring dedication to his fallen son) leaves
little room in his heart for new romance. He remains singularly focused on vengeance and protecting
what remains of his family and nation. (If a PC attempts to court him, Genn will gently but firmly remind
them that his duty and grief consume him. At most, a deep friendship can form, built on mutual respect as
warriors.)
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If the PC ever betrays Gilneas or the Alliance – for instance, by siding with
Sylvanas’s aggression or allowing Gilnean civilians to come to harm – Genn’s fury is swift. He will revoke any
trust and potentially become an adversary. For example, if the PC stood by while Horde looters slaughtered
Gilnean villagers, Genn would invoke a compel on his aspect “Betrayed by an Ally” to refuse any further
aid. He might publicly accuse the PC of treachery, making them an outcast among Alliance forces. In an1
23

extreme case, failing to uphold Gilnean honor could drive Genn to take unilateral action – such as launching
his own revenge mission against the Horde, complicating the war (and perhaps forcing the PCs to choose
between supporting Genn or following Anduin’s orders). The GM should note if the PC’s choices
estrange Genn; it may shift the campaign’s politics (e.g. Gilnean forces withdraw unless the PC atones).
Rewards (Gear, Boons): By completing Genn’s personal quests, PCs can earn unique Gilnean relics or
boons:
- Fang of the First Worgen: A ceremonial dagger carved from an ancient worgen fang, gifted by Genn. Item
Aspect: “Fang of the First Worgen” – once per scene the PC may invoke it for +2 to Intimidation (the fang’s
presence instills primal fear) or to add a “Bleeding Wound” aspect when cutting a supernatural foe.
- Worgen’s Mantle: A heavy wolf-fur cloak given to the PC in recognition of their loyalty. Aspect: “Howling
Descent” – the PC can invoke this cloak to overcome fear in darkness or when outnumbered (+2 to resist
Intimidation or mental attacks once per session). The mantle’s aura carries Gilnean resolve,
emboldening its wearer.
- Stunt – King’s Resolve: Genn’s personal instruction grants the PC a custom stunt. Effect: Once per session,
the PC may Carefully or Forcefully overcome a social or will-based obstacle with +2 by invoking their status
as Genn’s chosen champion. For example, the PC could calm a panicked crowd or stare down a political
opponent by reminding them that they act with King Greymane’s authority.
- Ally Aspect – “Gilnean Loyalist”: The PC earns this aspect for their distinguished service to Gilneas (e.g.
front-line heroics in a major battle). It grants a free invoke in situations where the PC protects Gilnean
people or fights alongside Genn’s forces. Essentially, the PC’s reputation as a Gilnean hero precedes
them, inspiring allies or staying Genn’s wrath if the PC calls on their past friendship.
King Anduin Wrynn (Alliance)
Psychological Profile: Anduin Wrynn is the young King of Stormwind, kind-hearted but under immense
wartime strain. He “values mercy but knows he must grow tougher” to end the war honorably. Anduin’s
motivation is to protect the innocent and seek peace; he genuinely hopes to unite people through faith (in
the Light) and diplomacy rather than bloodshed. Deep down, Anduin fears becoming like his father Varian
in his darker moments – he worries that wrath or despair might push him to atrocities if he’s not careful. He
carries a “heart of gold”, believing in the Light’s grace and that even enemies can find redemption.
However, the trauma of this war tests his idealism. At times, the weight of loss cracks Anduin’s resolve – for
example, he is haunted by the memory of Varian’s death and the devastation at Teldrassil, which challenge
his commitment to never harm innocents. Throughout BfA, Anduin matures from a hesitant boy king
into a true leader: learning to make hard choices without losing compassion. He remains gentle and
empathetic in personal interactions, but will show steel when his people are endangered. Anduin’s faith in
the Light and in the basic goodness of others is both his greatest strength and a source of inner conflict in a
brutal war.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept: “Young King of Stormwind, Burdened by Duty and Hope.” Trouble: “Torn Between
Mercy and War” (his ideals vs. wartime realities). Other Aspects: “Heart of Gold” and “Faith of the Light.”
These encapsulate Anduin’s role as a youthful but idealistic monarch, his profound compassion, and the
internal conflict between his pacifist instincts and the necessity of battle.
- Approaches: Careful +4, Quick +3, Clever +3, Forceful +1, Flashy +1, Sneaky +0. (Anduin is thoughtful,
tactical and measured. He plans and observes (Careful 4, Clever 3) rather than charging in recklessly. He10

isn’t physically imposing or flamboyant in combat, hence lower Forceful/Flashy, but he can react quickly
when lives are on the line.)
- Stunts: Inspirational Prayer – Once per scene, if Anduin is present, he can Flashily create an aspect
“Inspired by the King’s Resolve” – a brief prayer or rallying call that grants an ally +2 on a crucial roll (free
invoke). (E.g. the PC hears Anduin’s voice encouraging them, bolstering their next action.) Light’s
Embrace – Anduin may spend a moment in meditation to heal others. He can Carefully remove a Mild or
Moderate mental consequence from an ally by channeling the Light (treat as using Lore or Will skill for a
calming, healing ritual). Lion’s Courage – (custom stunt) Once per session, Anduin’s steadfast example
lets all nearby allies resist fear or despair. When facing a fear effect or mind-control, allies (including the PC)
may gain +2 on a Will defense roll, as Anduin’s presence inspires unyielding courage.
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 3, Mental 4. Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6).
(Anduin is not a frontline brawler, hence slightly lower physical tolerance, but his mental fortitude is strong
due to faith and training.)
Trust-Building Questline: Anduin’s personal arc centers on helping him reconcile mercy with the harsh
duties of war. The PC can earn his trust by consistently exemplifying the Alliance’s virtues that Anduin
himself cherishes. Milestones (each could correspond to an Act in the campaign) include:
1. Heart Over Hate (Act I): When faced with a captured or surrendering Horde combatant early in the war,
the PC urges mercy. For example, after the Battle for Lordaeron, a distraught Horde soldier begs for life; if
the PC prevents vengeance killings or ensures prisoners are treated humanely, Anduin notices. This
compassionate choice impresses him and he later cites it in council debates as proof that honor can temper
fury.
2. Inspirational Leadership (Act II – Alliance War Council): During a strategy meeting in Stormwind
(before the Kul Tiras campaign), the PC proposes a battle plan or solution that prioritizes saving civilians or
allies’ lives. Perhaps the PC insists on evacuating a village before engaging the enemy, or they devise a
clever way to use Azerite for defense rather than mass destruction. If this plan succeeds, Anduin privately
acknowledges the PC’s wisdom. He marks this as a sign of the PC’s growing leadership, giving a knowing
nod or a few words of thanks – a big gesture for the soft-spoken king.
3. Shared Sorrow (Act III, between major battles): In a quiet interlude, the PC comforts Anduin as he
mourns his father Varian or the many losses of the war. This could be at Varian’s tomb or during a memorial
for Teldrassil. By listening and sharing their own experiences with grief, the PC helps Anduin carry the
emotional burden. This empathy fills another segment of Anduin’s “Trust clock,” showing him that the PC
not only fights well but also cares deeply. 
When Anduin’s trust is fully earned, he formally acknowledges the PC’s influence on him. He might write a
personal commendation for the PC, present it before the Alliance Assembly, or publicly thank them in front
of other leaders. Anduin could even include the PC in high-level strategic discussions, treating them as a
close advisor. Reward: The PC gains “Anduin’s Trust” as an Aspect (invokable for +2 when dealing with
Alliance officials, generals, or nobles). This reflects that the weight of the High King’s backing is behind the
PC’s words – doors open within the Alliance when it’s known Anduin trusts you. Additionally, Anduin might
grant a boon such as a personal letter of safe passage that lets the PC invoke the King’s authority to
defuse conflicts with Alliance troops or request aid in the field.
Bonding Arc (Mentorship): Anduin, though young, can mentor the PC in subjects of leadership, faith, and
even combat strategy (drawing on lessons from Varian and Bolvar). Key training moments:
- Warrior’s Creed: Noticing the PC’s martial potential (or perhaps their aggressive tendencies), Anduin
invites them to spar in Stormwind’s barracks under the watch of Varian’s old instructors. He emphasizes21
22

discipline over bloodlust. Reward: The PC learns a stunt “Lion’s Roar” – once per conflict, when an enemy
has been demoralized or an ally has fallen, the PC can Forcefully attack with +2 (channeling Anduin’s ideal
of fighting harder when hope is fading). Narratively, this represents Anduin teaching the PC to turn
grief into courage, much as he has tried to do.
- Cleric’s Prayer: Sensing the PC could benefit from spiritual fortitude, Anduin accompanies them to the
Cathedral of Light in Stormwind for a private prayer session. He guides them through a ritual of the Holy
Light, teaching compassion and focus. Mechanic: The PC gains the “Holy Benediction” feat – once per
session, they may spend a Fate point to heal an ally’s Mild physical or mental consequence (or grant
comfort in roleplay). This requires them to perform a brief prayer or comforting act, as learned from
Anduin.
- Council of Equals: In a later Act (perhaps Act IV, before the final confrontation), Anduin holds a
confidential strategy discussion with the PC, treating them as an equal. He quizzes the PC on difficult moral
choices – e.g. “Would you sacrifice a few to save many?” – to understand their values. In turn he shares his
own dilemmas faced during the war. This solidifies their camaraderie. When on missions together
thereafter, the PC and Anduin develop a combined stunt: “Light of Two Hearts.” Effect: Once per scene, if
the PC fights alongside Anduin (literally or invoking his inspiration if afar), they gain +2 to resist fear, mind
control, or despair (Will defense). This represents their shared conviction in each other and the Light
strengthening their will. (GM note: if Anduin is not physically present, the PC can invoke a memory of Anduin’s
words to trigger this, as a way to show their bond transcends distance.)
Romance Arc (Optional): It’s possible for a PC around Anduin’s age and station (e.g. a young noble knight,
priest, etc. of the Alliance) to kindle a gentle romance with the king. This would develop slowly from
friendship, given Anduin’s responsibilities and modest nature. Initial sparks might be subtle: quiet moments
of comfort in the war-torn Chapel at Lordaeron, or tending the wounded together by lantern light. Pivotal
steps could include the PC earning the trust of Anduin’s closest friends or mentors (such as Genn Greymane
or Prophet Velen), and the PC helping Anduin remember his own needs amid duty. Milestones in the
romance might be:
- Kindred Souls: Anduin and the PC share personal stories during an interlude (for example, lighting
candles for the fallen in Stormwind’s Cathedral at midnight). The PC’s empathy and unwavering support
allow Anduin to open up about his doubts and fears. This advances an “Intimacy clock.”
- Public Support: The PC stands by Anduin in a moment of political or personal crisis – perhaps defending
his more compassionate decision in a war council when others disparage it. Seeing the PC risk reputation
for him moves Anduin deeply.
- Proof of Mercy: The PC goes out of their way to save citizens (or even Horde civilians) in Anduin’s name,
showing that his influence has spread through someone who cares for him. 
If the romance fully blooms, Anduin might in private acknowledge the PC as more than a friend. He could
give them a very personal gift, like a locket containing a drop of his sacred Light’s Tears (a holy water created
from his prayer), or invite them to accompany him in a diplomatic mission as an unofficial consort.
Ultimately, he may even entrust them with duties normally reserved for family. Conclusion: Anduin publicly
(though gently) signals the relationship – for instance, he might thank the PC in a speech as “a light in my life
amid darkness.” The PC then gains the Aspect “Beloved of the Lion.” This can be invoked for +2 in Alliance
high society situations, since being the King’s acknowledged beloved grants great prestige (and conversely,
harming or disrespecting the PC becomes unthinkable to most loyal Alliance folk). (GM tip: Keep the
romance tasteful and gradual. Anduin is very reserved; a slow courtship of shared ideals suits him. Any open
romance might only be declared after the war in an epilogue, but the bond can influence the story before then.)1927

Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If the PC advocates cruelty or betrays Anduin’s core values, he will be
heartbroken and angered. For example, if the PC pushes for the slaughter of a group of Horde civilians or
executes prisoners against Anduin’s orders, Anduin will recoil in shock. He might invoke a compel on
“Broken Vow” (representing his shaken faith) to refuse the PC’s counsel thereafter. In roleplay, Anduin’s
demeanor toward the PC turns cold and distant; he may say, “I thought I knew you… perhaps I was
mistaken.” In extreme cases – say the PC outright betrays the Alliance or conspires with Sylvanas – Anduin’s
grief could turn to righteous fury. While he is unlikely to seek vengeance, he could expel the PC from the
Alliance, or if the betrayal caused great loss, he might for the first time consider unforgiving action. (E.g. if
the PC’s betrayal led to deaths of innocents, Anduin might confront them with anger akin to Varian’s,
though it would pain him to do so.) Alternatively, if the PC simply fails to support Anduin in a critical moral
stand (like abandoning him when he tries to negotiate a truce), Anduin may turn to others (Jaina, Genn, or
even a neutral party like Magni) for guidance, effectively writing the PC out of his inner circle. This closes
off his questlines; the PC would need extraordinary deeds to regain his trust (if at all).
Unique Rewards: As the High King, Anduin can bestow significant boons to a trusted companion:
- Anduin’s Signet: A small golden signet ring bearing Stormwind’s royal crest, given in friendship. Aspect:
“Light’s Embrace” – once per session, the PC may invoke this for +2 on any roll to heal or to calm frightened
allies. The ring carries Anduin’s Light-blessed aura, soothing wounds and fear when the PC holds it.
- Blade of the Lion: A masterwork ceremonial longsword from Stormwind’s vaults, inscribed with Varian’s
motto. Special: When the PC wields this blade alongside Anduin in battle, it grants an aspect “Guard of the
Lion” – once per scene, the PC can invoke it to absorb one attack’s damage for an adjacent ally (splitting the
damage with the ally). This symbolizes the PC and Anduin protecting each other back-to-back, as the
spirit of the Alliance’s unity. (If Anduin is not physically present, the sword’s aspect might be invoked if the
PC is defending an Alliance ideal or ally dear to Anduin, at GM’s discretion.)
- Stunt – King’s Favor: Because of their close relationship, the PC gains a stunt reflecting Anduin’s political
backing. Effect: Once per session, the PC gains +2 on social rolls when speaking in Alliance councils or
making requests on behalf of the Alliance. Ministers and generals listen when they know “the King
trusts this hero.”
- Ally Aspect – “Heir of Stormwind”: If the PC’s actions alongside Anduin were especially legendary (saving
Stormwind or uniting Alliance races), the Alliance populace comes to regard the PC almost like a member of
the royal family. The PC gains Heir of Stormwind as an aspect (invoke for +2 when protecting Stormwind or
invoking Varian’s legacy in word or deed). For example, the PC might invoke this when organizing the
defense of Stormwind’s walls or when attempting to sway someone by evoking King Varian’s honor, as
people see the PC as carrying on that legacy.
Lady Jaina Proudmoore (Alliance)
Psychological Profile: Jaina Proudmoore is the Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras and a powerful sorceress, carrying
heavy burdens of guilt and responsibility. Once an optimistic archmage who strove for peace, the tragedies
of Theramore (destroyed by Garrosh) and the death of her father Daelin have hardened her. By the time of
BfA, Jaina is wracked with guilt for “betraying” her father’s memory (by allowing him to die at Theramore
years ago) and for failing to prevent the fall of Theramore. She has built emotional walls around her heart,
but “hope’s new spark” can still be kindled within her. Jaina’s personality oscillates between regal,
determined leader and haunted, sorrowful daughter. She is fiercely protective of Kul Tiras once she reconciles
with her mother, and fiercely loyal to the Alliance, yet she remains cautious about trusting the Horde after
so many betrayals. In war councils she is strategic, decisive, and sometimes advocates harsh action against33

the Horde (a contrast to Anduin’s temperance), but she is not cruel – her anger is rooted in trauma. Beneath
her stern exterior, Jaina is compassionate and deeply yearns for forgiveness (from her people and herself).
She also has a nurturer’s side (shown in how she treats Derek Proudmoore and the orphaned). Her greatest
fear is that her choices will lead to more loved ones dying or that she’ll become as cold as the foes she
fights. Jaina’s motivations are to protect her homeland Kul Tiras, uphold her father’s legacy as a defender of
the seas, and to prevent any future Mana Bomb-like horrors by keeping the Horde in check. Over BfA, Jaina
goes through a catharsis – from exile and self-loathing to redemption and acceptance as Kul Tiras’s leader,
largely thanks to the aid of the Alliance champion (the PC) and her family.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept: “Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras – Brilliant Archmage and Fleet Commander.” Trouble:
“Haunted by Betrayals and Lost Loved Ones” (trauma from Arthas, Theramore, Daelin’s death weighs on
her). Other: “Daughter of the Sea” (Kul Tiran heritage and oceanic magic) and “Heart Aflame, Yet Frozen by
Regret.” These aspects cover Jaina’s identity as a leader-sorceress, her emotional scars, her affinity for sea
and frost magic, and the conflict between her passionate hope and the coldness of grief.
- Approaches: Clever +4, Flashy +3, Careful +2, Forceful +2, Quick +1, Sneaky +0. (Jaina is an extremely
clever strategist and mage, often the smartest in the room. She can be flashy in demonstrating magic or
authority – think summoning a massive water elemental or arriving dramatically on a flagship – and she
plans carefully but will forcefully strike with powerful spells when needed. She isn’t particularly physical or
sneaky; she usually doesn’t hide who she is.)
- Stunts: Portal Mastery – Jaina’s skill in teleportation is unparalleled. Once per session, she (or an ally
she guides) may Cleverly overcome an obstacle by teleporting or creating a portal without needing a roll. For example, escaping a sealed cave, bypassing a collapsed bridge, or repositioning forces on a
battlefield can be done instantly via Jaina’s portals (the GM may still impose costs or narrative constraints,
but no roll is needed for the attempt). Ring of Frost – Jaina can Carefully create an advantage by encasing
an area in magical frost. Once per scene, she may place an aspect like “Encased in Ice” on a zone or enemy,
granting +2 to allies’ attempts to hinder or escape that enemy. Proudmoore Admiralty – As Lord Admiral,
Jaina commands Kul Tiran ships. Once per session, if near a coastline or with a sending stone to her
flagship, she can Flashily call in a naval barrage or naval support to automatically overcome an obstacle like
an enemy fortification (narratively, cannons obliterate it) or create an aspect “Pinned by Naval Fire” on
enemies, no roll required.
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 3, Mental 4 (Jaina has strong will and mental resilience). Consequences:
Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6).
Personal Questlines: Jaina’s questlines are interwoven with the Alliance campaign in Kul Tiras (Acts II–III)
and the later war against Sylvanas/Azshara (Acts IV–V). They focus on trust, atonement, mentorship, and
possible romance:
Trust Quest – *“Daughter of the Sea’s Return”: Chronology: Act II, during the Kul Tiras storyline.
Jaina begins BfA estranged from her homeland, seen as a traitor by Kul Tirans due to her role in
Daelin’s death years ago. The PC plays a crucial role in freeing Jaina from Thros (the realm of Py’rate’s
guilt) and reconciling her with her mother, Katherine. Milestones:
Rescue from Thros: The PC leads the effort (with Taelia and Katherine Proudmoore) to rescue Jaina
from the Shadowlands of Thros where she’s imprisoned by Lady Ashvane’s bargain. By braving Jaina’s
literal nightmares and guilt (facing apparitions of Daelin and Theramore’s victims) and refusing to
abandon her, the PC proves their devotion to Jaina’s well-being. Jaina, upon being freed and seeing41

the PC extend a hand of friendship rather than judgment, forms a deep grateful connection. (Mark a
big segment of trust here.) 
Proudmoore Reconciliation: At the Stormsong Valley gathering where Katherine Proudmoore
reinstates Jaina, the PC publicly vouches for Jaina’s honor. Perhaps the PC retrieved evidence of
Ashvane’s treachery or spoke in Jaina’s defense to the Kul Tiran crowd. This act helps turn the tide of
public opinion. Jaina notices the PC’s unwavering support and counts them as one of the few who
stood by her when almost everyone condemned her. 
Defending Kul Tiras: In a later battle (e.g. during the Siege of Boralus or a sea battle against
Ashvane’s fleet), the PC fights fiercely to protect Kul Tiras under Jaina’s command. For instance, the
PC might take command of a battery on Jaina’s flagship Fearless to fend off enemy ships, or save
civilians in Boralus during a pirate attack. Seeing the PC risk life and limb for her homeland cements
Jaina’s trust – they are no mere outsider, but a true ally of Kul Tiras. 
Outcome: When these quests are completed, Jaina’s personal trust in the PC is absolute. She might invite
the PC to stand by her side as an advisor in the Klimitar War Council or to join her on the deck of her
flagship as she sails into battle (a place of honor). She possibly shares with them the Proudmoore family
words or a private story of Daelin to signify they’re “like family.” Mechanically, the PC gains “Trust of Lady
Proudmoore” as an aspect, giving +2 when dealing with any Kul Tiran or Alliance naval matters (everyone in
Kul Tiras knows the PC is Jaina’s trusted champion). Additionally, Jaina could craft a Portal Rune for the PC –
a small stone that, once per session, allows the PC to invoke it to either teleport to Boralus or call Jaina’s aid
(GM’s discretion for narrative timing). This represents Jaina’s readiness to assist her trusted friend even from
afar.
Mentorship Quest – *“Mentorship of the Lady Mage”: If the PC is magically inclined or
intellectually curious, Jaina can become a mentor figure. Even if the PC is not a mage, she can teach
leadership and crisis management. Key scenes/training:
Arcane Lesson in the Library: Jaina grants the PC access to the private library in Unity Square,
Boralus (or the Sanctum in Dalaran if more fitting), guiding them through an ancient tome on
defensive wards. Together they might stabilize a dangerous rift as a trial (for example, closing an
Azerite fissure threatening to flood Boralus with raw magic). Result: The PC learns a stunt “Sorcerous
Tutelage” – they gain +2 to Cleverly overcome or create an advantage when dealing with magical
research or identifying spells. This reflects Jaina’s personal tutoring in arcane theory. If the PC
isn’t a spellcaster, instead they get “Calm Under Crisis” – once per scene, if the PC opts to Carefully
defuse a social conflict (like appeasing an angry mob or negotiating a ceasefire), they gain +2,
channeling Jaina’s poise under pressure. 
Sea Ward Ritual: On the eve of battle with Azshara’s naga, Jaina performs a ritual at the Tide Altar in
Stormsong, invoking the Kul Tiran tide sages. She involves the PC in the casting. The PC must
maintain concentration alongside her as waves crash around. Through this, the PC learns to focus
amidst chaos. Reward/Aspect: “Baptized by the Sea” – the PC can invoke this aspect when navigating
ships or resisting fear of the ocean depths (useful in Act V Nazjatar scenes). It also signifies Jaina’s
acknowledgment of them as a Kul Tiran tideguard in spirit. 
Strategic Counsel: Jaina and the PC plan a joint Alliance–Horde strike (like the Rescue of Baine in
Act IV). Jaina has the PC take the lead in part of the plan (say, formulating the infiltration route into
Orgrimmar). If the mission succeeds, Jaina publicly commends the PC’s planning. Mechanic: The PC
gains “Alliance Fleet Tactician” stunt – once per conflict, by invoking Jaina’s mentorship, the PC can
reroll a failed Clever action related to battlefield tactics or coordination (e.g. ordering allies around
effectively). This represents Jaina instilling her strategic acumen in the PC. •

Jaina’s mentorship completes when the PC demonstrates what they’ve learned without her aid – for
instance, the PC might broker a temporary ceasefire with a Horde commander in the field, or cast a difficult
spell on their own that saves lives. At that point, Jaina might smile proudly and say something like, “You have
become a leader in your own right. My father would be proud of you too.” The PC now has her full confidence in
matters of magic and war.
Romance Quest – *“Heart’s New Hope”: (Optional, lore-appropriate) Jaina has built high walls
around her heart after her past heartbreaks (Arthas Menethil’s fall, and a brief, quiet relationship
with the blue dragon Kalecgos that ended prior to BfA). However, it’s possible for a noble, kind PC to
gently break through her emotional defenses. This romance would be a very slow burn, likely
only blossoming by Act V or post-campaign epilogue, due to her duties. Progression:
Kindred Spirits at War: The PC consistently demonstrates the virtues Jaina admires – mercy,
bravery, wisdom in strategy. They might stay up late with her in war rooms, talking over maps
and reminiscing about simpler times. In one scene, maybe the PC shares a light-hearted joke to lift
Jaina’s spirits, and she laughs softly – a rare sound in dark days. These subtle moments plant the
seed of affection. Jaina may start confiding in the PC – e.g. revealing a childhood memory of Arthas
or asking if they think she’s doing the right thing – indicating deep trust. 
Breaking the Guilt: One pivotal moment could involve the PC helping Jaina forgive herself. For
instance, after confronting the vision of her father in Thros or after the Battle of Dazar’alor where
Alliance actions led to King Rastakhan’s death (which troubles Jaina’s conscience), the PC reassures
her that her decisions saved more lives than they cost. The PC might retrieve or protect something
symbolically important to Jaina – e.g. saving the family heirloom kul Tiran pendant that Daelin gave
her, before it’s lost in the chaos of battle. This act could symbolize to Jaina that she’s allowed to
hold onto love and hope. Tears might be shed as Jaina thanks the PC, a crack in the ice around her
heart. 
Declaration in Peace: If the war ends favorably and both survive, Jaina, emotionally raw after so
much loss, might finally confess her feelings. Perhaps after Sylvanas’s defeat, as the Alliance
celebrates in Stormwind, Jaina finds the PC in a quiet garden or on a balcony overlooking the sea.
She admits, haltingly, “When this war began, I never imagined I’d feel this way again… But you’ve been a
true friend through it all… more than a friend, perhaps, if the world ever allows it.”. Given her
duties, she’d likely propose taking things slow – maybe inviting the PC to visit her in Boralus or
accompany her on a diplomatic voyage, symbolizing a hope for a life beyond war. 
Romance Benefits: If fully realized, romancing Jaina grants the PC a special aspect “Jaina’s Devotion”.
This could be invoked once in a while (GM’s discretion, perhaps once per session) to automatically succeed
at a scholarly or diplomatic task that Jaina could have guided them on, or even to call upon Jaina’s direct aid
in a tight spot. For example, if the PC is negotiating a peace and needs the perfect words, invoking
Jaina’s Devotion might flash back to a heartfelt conversation with her that gives them insight to succeed.
Alternatively, if the PC faces a deadly magical threat, invoking the aspect might mean Jaina herself portals in
at the last second to assist (this should be dramatic and not overused). Moreover, being Jaina’s beloved
might make the PC a celebrated figure in Kul Tiras; the Proudmoore Admiralty might treat them almost like
royalty. (Note: If the GM or players prefer to keep things platonic, Jaina can remain simply a close ally. The
above offers a possible romantic route for players interested, while respecting Jaina’s character
development.)
Loyalty Quest – *“Alliance Unity (Faction Loyalty)”: Through Jaina’s advocacy and the PC’s
heroism, the PC can become a symbol of Alliance unity – a champion who all Alliance races respect,
much like Jaina herself has come to represent hope and cooperation. Requirements: The PC must•

consistently act to heal rifts and promote cooperation within the Alliance (and even cross-faction
when feasible). Examples in play: preventing vengeful Alliance troops from executing Horde
prisoners at the Battle of Lordaeron, orchestrating a temporary Alliance-Horde truce to fight a
greater threat (such as teaming up with Horde champions to defeat Azshara in Nazjatar), or saving
Allied race forces (Void Elves, Lightforged, etc.) in side missions, thereby earning their gratitude. If the PC has romanced or befriended leaders (Anduin, Genn, etc.), those leaders could notice
the PC’s efforts toward unity. 
Reward: At campaign’s end, King Anduin (encouraged by Jaina) and other leaders honor the PC with a title –
perhaps “Hero of the Alliance” or even a unique role like Alliance Ambassador. In practical terms, the PC
gains the Aspect “Esteemed by the Alliance”. This can be invoked whenever rallying Alliance troops,
requesting aid/resources from any Alliance faction, or persuading Alliance officials. Because of Jaina’s and
others’ public endorsement, veterans from Ironforge to Darnassus listen when the PC speaks. The
GM can play out a ceremony scene: maybe in Stormwind or the Cathedral of Light, Jaina herself presents
the PC with a medal or a Proudmoore naval jacket as a sign of their valor. One narrative marker of this
completed quest could be an in-game scene where, at a critical juncture (say a negotiation with the Horde
in the epilogue), both Anduin and Jaina pause and look to the PC for input – showing that the PC’s voice now
carries decisive weight in Alliance affairs.
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If the PC somehow loses Jaina’s trust – perhaps by committing an atrocity in
Kul Tiras or betraying the Alliance – the repercussions are severe on a personal and faction level. Initially,
Jaina would react with hurt and anger. If, for example, the PC in a twist aligned with Sylvanas to strike Kul
Tiras (burning a fleet or enabling Ashvane’s coup), Jaina might confront the PC directly in a duel, invoking
her Wrath of the Tides. She would likely defeat the PC or force them to flee (unless the PC is very powerful),
but with tears in her eyes at having to fight a former friend. Politically, Jaina would label the PC a traitor,
stripping any titles or honors. The entire Kul Tiran fleet would be hostile on sight. On a smaller scale, if the
PC simply repeatedly ignored Jaina’s advice leading to big losses (say they insisted on a head-on attack that
got many Alliance soldiers killed needlessly), Jaina will stop including them in war councils and might argue
to Anduin that the PC is too rash to be trusted. The emotional toll on Jaina of a betrayal is significant – she
has been betrayed by loved ones before (Arthas, perhaps Kael’thas’s lies too), so this could send her into a
depressive spiral or a cold, distant state like after Theramore. The GM might depict her as reverting to the
vengeful mindset she had post-Theramore, but this time with the PC in mind: “I won’t be fooled by trust
again,” she could say, hardening her resolve. In the worst case, Jaina could become an implacable opponent
for the PC – if they joined the Horde or a villain, she might lead the assault to bring them to justice, no
quarter given.
Unique Rewards: Jaina can grant exceptional magical and naval rewards reflecting her dual nature as mage
and admiral:
- Proudmoore’s Pendant: A small seashell pendant on a chain, rune-inscribed by Jaina. Aspect: “Jaina’s
Ward” – this charm can be invoked to absorb or greatly reduce a harmful spell’s effect on the PC. For
instance, once per session the PC can invoke it to turn what would be a fatal Fireball into a mere scorch, or
to automatically overcome a magical fear effect by the pendant’s protective aura. Jaina presents it with a
gentle smile: “Take this – a bit of Kul Tiran ocean magic and my own enchantment. May it keep you safe when you
need it most.”
- Arcane Focusing Iris (Extra): Jaina grants the PC a crystalline focusing prism from the Dalaran archives
(perhaps one she recovered when she was leader of the Kirin Tor). Mechanics: The PC can attach this
Amplifying Gem to their weapon or hold it while casting. Once per session, it grants +2 on a significant
spellcasting or magical action – effectively letting the PC hit above their normal power level at a clutch55

moment by channeling stored energy. This is a one-use-per-session boost to represent Jaina’s enchantment
amplifying the PC’s magic.
- Daughter of the Sea (Ship/Mount): As Lord Admiral, Jaina could reward the PC with command of a ship
or a magical vessel. For example, she might place a Kul Tiran frigate and crew at the PC’s disposal in later
acts. If the campaign doesn’t support managing a whole ship, it could be abstracted as a Mount -like Extra:
The Wavecutter, a swift cutter-class ship (or enchanted rowboat) that the PC can use to travel sea locales
quickly. It might have an aspect “Favored by the Kul Tiran Winds” to invoke for fast travel or coastal
bombardments (GM can allow the PC to call limited naval fire support in littoral battles). Alternatively, Jaina
could summon a Water Elemental Steed for the PC – a mount made of living water that can gallop across
the ocean surface or as a tide spirit to carry the PC (treat as an aspect the PC can invoke for +2 to overcome
water hazards or pursue foes over water). This would be a unique gift signifying Jaina’s deep trust (similar to
how Khadgar was given an arcane gryphon).
- Title – “Champion of Kul Tiras”: Alongside the Alliance-wide honors, Jaina and Katherine might bestow a
formal title upon the PC within Kul Tiras (especially if the PC is not originally Kul Tiran). As Champion of Kul
Tiras, the PC is celebrated among the sailors and citizens; they gain the aspect “Champion of the Kul Tiran
Seas,” which grants +2 when rallying or commanding Kul Tiran forces, navigating treacherous oceans, or
drawing on Kul Tiran reputation (for example, getting aid in any seaport allied with Kul Tiras). This comes
with a literal badge or cloak bearing the Proudmoore anchor emblem.
High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind (Alliance/Night Elf)
Psychological Profile: Tyrande Whisperwind is the High Priestess of Elune and de facto leader of the Night
Elves (Kaldorei). She is devout, regal, and utterly committed to her people and goddess. For thousands of
years she balanced a compassionate “mother of her people” demeanor with a fierce warrior’s wrath –
especially when the survival of the Kaldorei is at stake. After the Burning of Teldrassil at the start of BfA,
Tyrande’s personality takes a darker turn: her “Night Warrior” aspect awakens, driven by righteous
vengeance against Sylvanas and the Horde. She becomes unyielding and stern, brooking no
hesitation in exacting justice for the atrocity. Yet she still has a deep well of compassion toward innocents
and those who show faith in Elune. Tyrande’s internal conflict has long been duty vs. love – exemplified
when she risked the safety of her temple to save Malfurion during Legion, revealing that her love for her
husband can override even her duty at times. Her greatest fear is the annihilation of the Night Elf
people and the loss of Elune’s favor. After seeing Teldrassil burn, Tyrande channels that fear into a cold,
sacred fury (by undergoing the Night Warrior ritual, she embraces the harsher aspect of Elune). She carries
immense sorrow (e.g. the death of her friend, the green dragon Ysera, weighs on her) but rarely shows
vulnerability. In BfA, Tyrande’s motivation is clear: avenge Teldrassil, protect what remains of her people,
and reclaim their homeland from the Horde. She struggles to cooperate with the Alliance at times because
her need for vengeance is so intense; she even parts ways from the main Alliance campaign to wage her
own war in Darkshore. Nevertheless, she remains a wise mentor to those who earn her respect, and her
faith in Elune is unshakable – she believes the goddess guides her steps, even the bloody ones.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept: “High Priestess of Elune – Moonlit Matriarch of the Kaldorei.” Trouble: “Burdened by
Millennia of Loss and Duty” (she has seen too many tragedies and carries the weight of each). Other:
“Night Warrior’s Wrath, Mother’s Love” – reflecting her dual nature as compassionate protector and
unforgiving avenger. Another could be “Chosen of Elune” indicating her status as the goddess’s
champion. These encapsulate her sacred authority, sorrow, and the razor-edge balance between mercy and67

wrath.
- Approaches: Careful +4, Clever +3, Forceful +2, Quick +2, Flashy +1, Sneaky +0. (Tyrande is ancient and
strategic – she Carefully plans and observes, having centuries of experience. She can act Cleverly when
needed, especially in guiding her people or outmaneuvering foes. In battle, she prefers Forceful direct
action or Quick strikes from the shadows via her Sentinels, though as a leader her presence can be Flashy
in inspiring others. Stealth is not her personal forte; she typically leads from the front or above with owl
scouts and moonlight.)
- Stunts: Moonlit Arrows – When Tyrande fires her bow under the moon or stars, she can imbue her
arrows with lunar magic. She may treat any ranged attack as Flashy (as moonlight dramatically illuminates
the shot) and gain +2 to hit, once per scene. Priestess’s Blessing – Once per session Tyrande can
perform a brief prayer to Elune to heal or cleanse. She can remove a Moderate consequence from an ally by
rolling Will + Lore (channeling divine magic). Mark of Elune (Boon): Tyrande bestows Elune’s mark on
an ally. Once per scene she can grant a free invoke of “Marked by Elune’s Light” to an ally, which that ally can
use on a roll to resist fear or to find guidance in darkness. (In practice, this might be an aspect on
the ally for that scene representing courage or clarity granted by moonlight.)
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 4, Mental 4 (Tyrande is very resilient both physically, as an immortal
night elf, and mentally, due to divine fortitude). Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6/7).
Trust-Building Questline: To earn Tyrande’s trust, the PC must demonstrate reverence for Elune and
genuine dedication to the Kaldorei cause, especially after the tragedy at Teldrassil. Tyrande is extremely
guarded in BfA, particularly toward non-Night Elves, given her people’s suffering. The questline might span
Acts II–IV (since Act I is the burning itself where trust begins at zero for most). Milestones (Trust Clock
segments):
1. Champion of the Moon (Act II): The PC volunteers to aid Tyrande’s forces in Darkshore during the
Warfront. In a pivotal battle, the PC defends a sacred site – for example, they hold off Horde desecrators at
the Ruins of Auberdine or protect a Moonwell from being corrupted. Successfully safeguarding a site
of Elune (or rescuing a wounded priestess under fire) shows Tyrande that the PC honors the Night Elves’
sacred ground. She takes notice, perhaps offering a silent nod of acknowledgment after the battle as she
kneels to bless the Moonwell the PC saved.
2. Tears of Elune (Act III): Tyrande tasks the PC with a quest deeply significant to her faith: recovering a lost
artifact or relic of Elune. For instance, retrieving a vial of Moonwell water from Teldrassil’s ashes, or
recovering the Tears of Elune (one of the Pillars of Creation, if not already accounted for) from a fallen foe’s
grasp. Alternatively, the PC might cleanse a corruption blighting the Shrine of the Moon in Stormwind
(where many Night Elf refugees pray after Teldrassil). By completing this task, the PC shows respect for
Elune’s power and Tyrande’s devotion. Tyrande greets them upon success with a formal blessing – touching
the PC’s forehead with a lunar sigil, a clear sign she’s beginning to trust them.
3. Defender of the Kaldorei (Act IV, during the rebellion against Sylvanas): The PC stands up for the
Night Elves in an Alliance/Horde council or a joint operation. For example, if tensions rise between Tyrande
and the Alliance leadership (Genn and Anduin often worried about her rage), the PC sides with Tyrande’s
demand for justice, persuading others to commit resources to liberate Darkshore or aid Night Elf refugees.
Or perhaps during the Siege of Orgrimmar (Mak’gora), the PC ensures Night Elf interests (like capturing
the Horde officer responsible for burning Ashenvale) are not sidelined. Demonstrating political or martial
support for Tyrande’s people fills another trust segment. Tyrande, unused to others outside her own
kind championing the Kaldorei cause, will show a subtle but meaningful sign of trust – she might allow the
PC to stand guard with her personal Sentinels or invite them to witness a private prayer ritual (a high honor,
as non-Night Elves rarely see those). 74

Completion: When the trust clock fills, Tyrande formally acknowledges the PC as a trusted champion of the
Night Elves. She could perform a midnight ceremony in the ruins of Darnassus or at the new refuges (e.g.
Mount Hyjal or Stormwind Park): naming the PC “Champion of Teldrassil’s Remnant” or even bestowing
an honor like “Darnassian Huntress/Hunter (honorary)”. She may gift them a portion of Elune’s blessing
for their valor. Reward: The PC gains the aspect “Friend of the Kaldorei”, which can be invoked for +2
on actions when calling upon Night Elf aid or invoking the respect of Tyrande’s people. For instance, the PC
could invoke it to gather Sentinel allies for a mission or to influence a stubborn Night Elf elder by reminding
them of Tyrande’s favor. Additionally, Tyrande might impart a Prayer Stone of Elune – a small moonstone
that once per session can be activated to create a “Moonlight Guidance” aspect. This could allow the PC to,
say, automatically navigate through a dark forest or receive a brief vision of the safest path (Elune’s
guidance manifest). It’s a tangible sign that Tyrande trusts the PC with Elune’s light.
Bonding Arc (Mentorship & Empowerment): Tyrande can mentor the PC in the ways of Elune and guerrilla
warfare. Her mentorship is often stern but nurturing in its own way. Scenes might include:
- Night Warrior’s Vigil: Tyrande brings the PC along on a stealth mission in Darkshore during the eternal
night she cast over it. Together, they stalk a Horde patrol. Tyrande shows the PC how to become the night –
hiding among shadows, striking fear with silence. Though Tyrande isn’t typically “sneaky,” under the Night
Warrior’s power she embodies vengeance in darkness. Mechanic: The PC gains the stunt “Unseen Sentinel.”
Once per scene, the PC can Carefully or Sneakily create the advantage “In the Shadows of Elune” with +2,
representing techniques learned from observing Tyrande’s deadly ambushes. For example, they might lay a
trap or hide their allies with uncanny silence, as Tyrande did while hunting in Ashenvale for millennia.
- Moonwell Communion: Tyrande invites the PC to meditate at a Moonwell with her. This could occur at the
restored Moonwell in Stormwind or in Moonglade under a full moon. In this spiritual scene, Tyrande chants
an ancient prayer and encourages the PC to listen for Elune’s voice or simply confront their own emotions.
The PC experiences a serene vision or perhaps sees a departed loved one in the moon’s reflection (GM’s
choice for emotional impact). Effect: The PC gains “Lunar Resilience.” This is an aspect (or boost) they can
invoke once to steel themselves against mental trauma or manipulation (like an Old God’s whisper or a
banshee’s scream). Narratively, the memory of the Moonwell’s peace and Tyrande’s presence fortifies their
mind. Tyrande is effectively teaching them how faith and focus can overcome horror.
- Archery and Patience: On a quieter note, Tyrande might tutor the PC in archery at dusk in Ashenvale,
under the tutelage of Delaryn Summermoon’s memory (Delaryn was a ranger captain who died at
Teldrassil). Tyrande’s lesson is not just marksmanship but patience and precision: “Breathe. Feel each
heartbeat. An arrow guided by purpose will find its mark.” The PC practices shooting wisps or floating targets
that Tyrande conjures with Elune’s light. Reward: The PC gains a stunt “Elune’s Aim.” Once per session, the
PC can Carefully aim an attack and declare it guided by Elune – if they describe waiting for the perfect
moment, they gain +2 to the attack and it ignores one point of the target’s armor (if any), symbolizing
almost supernatural accuracy. This stunt applies even if the PC isn’t normally an archer (it could flavor
thrown weapons or even spell targeting, as “true aim” granted by Tyrande’s lesson).
- Leadership under Loss: Tyrande and the PC share a solemn conversation at the grave of a beloved Night
Elf (perhaps at a memorial for those lost at Teldrassil, or for Ysera in Val’sharah). Tyrande speaks of
balancing grief and duty, how she sometimes envies mortal humans who experience far less loss over
shorter lives. She imparts that continuing to lead and love in the face of endless loss is what makes one
worthy of Elune’s blessings. Mechanic: The PC gains insight to call upon in dire situations. Once per session,
if an ally falls or a tragic event unfolds mid-mission, the PC can invoke an aspect “Guided by Ancient
Wisdom” for free, to immediately act with clarity instead of despair. (In effect, when others might freeze or
falter from a sudden loss, the PC, remembering Tyrande’s words, can push forward with determination –84
13

maybe a one-time cancel of a compel caused by an ally’s death or a free action to rally others.) This is a
more narrative boon but can be life-saving.
Completing Tyrande’s mentorship might be marked by a personal request she makes of the PC. For
example, she could say: “Should I ever falter on the path of vengeance… remind me of who I am.” If the PC later,
in the story climax, helps talk Tyrande down from a dangerous brink (like stopping her from executing a
surrendering foe in blind rage), that signifies they have truly become her confidant. Tyrande may then
acknowledge the PC as a “Dor’anu” (Elvish for favored friend or blessed one, GM can decide exact term). It’s
a bond that even Malfurion would respect – indeed, Malfurion might entrust the PC with watching over
Tyrande when he cannot.
Romance Arc: Unlikely. Tyrande’s love for her husband Malfurion Stormrage is a cornerstone of her life,
enduring for millennia. During BfA, Malfurion is injured during the War of Thorns but survives, and Tyrande
remains utterly devoted to him (indeed, part of her personal rage comes from nearly losing him to
Sylvanas’s ambush). As such, a player character cannot romance Tyrande in any conventional sense – she is
very much married and in love. However, one might develop a deep spiritual camaraderie that could be
interpreted as an intense platonic bond. At most, the PC could become a kind of confidant who Malfurion
and Tyrande both trust, but the relationship with Tyrande would never cross into betrayal of Malfurion. (In
essence, romance is not available here beyond friendship. The WotLK precedent: Tyrande’s focus is duty over
any new desire.) Tyrande might say to a particularly caring PC, “Your heart is noble… but mine already belongs
to another, now and forever.” That said, she could express sisterly or motherly affection if the PC significantly
helps her people – like a gentle touch on the cheek saying, “Elune shine upon you, dear friend,” which for
Tyrande is a great warmth.
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If the PC ever acts against the Kaldorei or Elune, Tyrande’s wrath is swift and
unforgiving. Examples: If the PC, while in Horde territory or due to some plot, participated in an atrocity
against Night Elves (burning a village, desecrating a Moonwell) and Tyrande learns of it, she would mark
them as an enemy of Elune. She might even undergo a special prayer to curse the PC (a GM could impose a
narrative consequence or mark that cannot be easily removed – e.g. “Curse of Dark Moon” causing them
misfortune when facing Night Elf magic). Should the PC side with Sylvanas at any point or prevent Tyrande’s
vengeance (like physically stopping Tyrande from killing a Horde officer who absolutely deserved it in her
eyes), Tyrande will consider the PC complicit in denying justice. She could compel her Night Warrior’s
Wrath to target the PC, potentially leading to a duel or confrontation. For instance, if during the final
rebellion the PC argued to spare certain Horde leaders, Tyrande might snarl “Then you are no friend of
Teldrassil” and refuse further cooperation. In an extreme split where the PC outright betrays the Alliance or
aids Sylvanas, Tyrande may leave the Alliance coordination entirely to hunt the PC down in the shadows,
invoking a personal vendetta. (GM note: Tyrande is not one to offer second chances easily in this era; betrayal
likely permanently ends her questlines and turns her into a threat. PCs should tread carefully in earning her ire.)
An alternate outcome short of full betrayal might be if the PC fails her tests – say they abandon the defense
of a Moonwell to chase personal glory; Tyrande’s trust clock could simply remain unfilled, and she’d keep
the PC at arm’s length, never giving them the deeper honors or tasks. The campaign would then show
Tyrande accomplishing certain goals without the PC (perhaps the GM narrates how Tyrande acted alone
rather than calling on the PC). Essentially, the PC would miss out on her story and boons.
Unique Rewards: By aligning with Tyrande, the PC may receive sacred artifacts and boons of Elune:
- Bow of the Night Warrior: If the PC is ranged-combat oriented, Tyrande might gift them a revered bow
from the Sentinel armory – “Dorian’s Wrath”, for example (named after a legendary archer). Aspect: “Blessed
14

by the Moon” – once per session, the PC can invoke this bow to inflict a special effect on an enemy: either +2
on a ranged attack or cause the target to be outlined in silvery moonlight (making them unable to hide or
become invisible for the scene). Under a moonlit sky, the bow’s power is even said to frighten those of evil
heart who are struck, as they feel Elune’s judgment.
- Tear of Elune (Token): A small vial containing water from a Moonwell, blessed by Tyrande. Use: Once
per session, the PC may invoke “Tear of Elune – Token of Night Elf Gratitude” to either purify a minor
magical effect (e.g. cleanse a curse or poison on someone) or to add +2 on social interactions with Night
Elves or other followers of Elune. (For example, showing this token might convince a distrustful Night Elf
village to accept the PC’s aid.)
- Stunt – Blessed by the Moon: The PC internalizes a bit of Elune’s grace. Effect: Once per session, when the
PC is Defending an ally who is faithful to Elune (e.g. protecting a wounded Sentinel or standing between an
innocent and harm), the PC may spend a Fate point to add +2 to any defense roll. Narratively, a soft
moonlight glints around them, turning aside the blow. This stunt reflects Tyrande’s blessing manifesting in
dire moments of protection.
- Mount – Ashenvale Nightsaber: As a mark of esteem, the PC could receive an adult nightsaber from
Tyrande’s own stables. This great panther-like companion (with fur that shimmers with faint star patterns)
serves as a mount and battle-partner. In game terms, the Nightsaber could allow the PC to traverse forests
at great speed (invoke “Fleet of the Forest” for +2 to overcome distance or chase challenges) and grants an
edge in stealth approaches in wilderness (the Nightsaber can move silently, helping the PC Sneak in natural
environments). This reward emphasizes the PC being embraced by the Kaldorei – only those deeply trusted
(like Maiev Shadowsong’s wardens or Tyrande’s personal huntresses) are given nightsaber mounts.
- Ally Aspect – “Esteemed by the Kaldorei”: This aspect might be the capstone of Tyrande’s arc. It
signifies the entire Night Elf nation recognizes the PC as a true friend. It can be invoked in social or military
situations involving Night Elves – for example, commanding a unit of Sentinels who will obey the PC without
question, or accessing the normally secret library in the Temple of Elune at Mount Hyjal for research, etc.. It might even allow the PC to request an audience with the Ancients of the forest (like asking advice
from the treant Archdruid or the spirit of Cenarius, if alive in your timeline) because word of their deeds has
spread through the forests. Tyrande would mark this questline complete when the PC’s influence on
Kaldorei affairs is so great that she and her council proactively seek the PC’s counsel on major decisions
 – essentially the PC becomes an honorary member of the Kaldorei leadership circle.
Regent Lord Lor’themar Theron (Horde/Blood Elf)
Psychological Profile: Lor’themar Theron is the Regent Lord of Quel’Thalas and leader of the Blood Elves.
He is proud, duty-bound, and diplomatic by necessity. His core motivation is to rebuild Quel’Thalas and
ensure the prosperity and security of his people in a hostile world. Having survived the Scourge
devastation of Silvermoon and led his people through the loss of the Sunwell and its restoration, Lor’themar
cares deeply for every sin’dorei life. In BfA, he serves the Horde but harbors secret doubts about Sylvanas’s
extreme methods. He is torn between loyalty to the Horde (and Sylvanas, a fellow elf whom he once
served under) and his conscience that tells him the Horde is going astray. Outwardly, Lor’themar appears
stern, formal, and reserved – a seasoned statesman used to wearing a mask of composure. In truth, he’s
warm-hearted and values balance between pride and compassion. He can show dry wit and even
flirtation in private (as hinted by his banter with Thalyssra), but only when appropriate. Lor’themar’s
greatest fear is failing the sin’dorei – either through inaction or wrong action. He still feels the weight of
decisions like following Kael’thas (which he eventually broke from) and is determined not to repeat
mistakes. This makes him cautious and methodical. He constantly weighs duty vs. morality. For example,85

9394
9596
97
15

he initially follows Sylvanas but is one of the first to support Baine’s rescue, as he cannot condone
dishonorable acts. By the war’s end, Lor’themar effectively sides with the rebels. In interactions, he is
courteous, diplomatic, and appreciates those who show respect to Blood Elf culture. However, if someone
disrespects Quel’Thalas or pushes a Horde agenda that sacrifices his people, Lor’themar’s demeanor goes
cold and unyielding. He’s also a skilled ranger (formerly second-in-command to Sylvanas as Ranger
General), so he’s cunning in battle and an excellent archer. Summarily, Lor’themar is a leader trying to
reconcile the Horde’s needs with his people’s, longing for peace but prepared for war, and open to counsel
from those he trusts.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept: “Regent Lord of Quel’Thalas – Stoic Protector of the Blood Elves.” Trouble: “Torn
Loyalty to the Horde vs. my People” (he is conflicted serving a Horde led by Sylvanas’s ruthlessness while
safeguarding his nation). Other: “Burning Passion for Rebirth” (dedicated to restoring Silvermoon’s
glory) and “Stiff Dignity, Hidden Warmth” (his formal exterior vs. his genuine care). These encapsulate his
role as leader, internal conflict, and personality nuances.
- Approaches: Careful +4, Quick +3, Clever +2, Forceful +2, Flashy +1, Sneaky +0. (Lor’themar is a careful
planner and a skilled marksman – Quick reflects his agility with a bow and reaction speed in duels, Careful
is max because he strategizes and observes keenly. He has a Clever tactical mind and is a capable frontline
fighter ( Forceful moderate). He isn’t especially showy ( Flashy low) and rarely acts in shadows himself
(Sneaky 0, he leaves stealth ops to Farstriders like Valeera or others).)
- Stunts: Sunfury Discipline – Lor’themar can draw on the legendary discipline of the Farstriders and the
memory of the Sunstrider dynasty. Once per scene, he may spend a Fate point to counter an opponent’s
advantage or aspect creation by sheer force of will and training. Narratively, if an enemy tries to
intimidate or trick the Horde council, Lor’themar’s stern interjection can nullify it; if an enemy mage creates
a flaming hazard, Lor’themar’s precise arrow could disrupt the spell. Arcane Swiftness – Due to his training
and the Sunwell’s energizing presence, Lor’themar gets +2 to Quickly resist any ranged or magical attack. (In practice, he can, for example, deftly dodge an incoming arrow or counterspell a magical bolt
headed his way.) Phoenix’s Wrath – Custom: Once per conflict, when Lor’themar hits a target with a
magically-imbued arrow or attack, he can add +2 shifts of effect/damage, evoking the burning rebirth
of the phoenix (the symbol of the Blood Elves, tied to the Sunwell’s power). This reflects a moment of fierce
offense where his attack erupts in radiant fire.
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 3, Mental 3 (he’s balanced, not a berserker like an orc nor a frail caster; a
capable fighter and leader). Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6). He can take hits but prefers
not to be in melee slugfests, so his tolerance is moderate.
Trust-Building Questline: Lor’themar’s trust is earned through service to Quel’Thalas and understanding
of Blood Elf heritage. The PC (especially if not a Blood Elf) must prove they respect and will protect the
interests of Silvermoon. This likely happens in Acts II–III (Zandalar/Kul Tiras campaign) and Act IV (the
internal Horde conflict). Milestones:
1. Reclaiming Quel’Thalas’s Glory (Act II): The PC assists in a mission related to Blood Elf lands. For
example, there might be a quest to clear out lingering undead in the Ghostlands or to drive hostile
squatters (like rogue warbands) from the Sunstrider ruins. One idea: the PC helps Lor’themar’s rangers
reclaim a lost outpost in Eversong Woods (perhaps Windrunner Spire, tied to Sylvanas’s family). By securing
a piece of Quel’Thalas and honoring its legacy (maybe the PC respectfully handles an artifact of the
Sunstrider line found there), they earn Lor’themar’s gratitude. He acknowledges the PC’s effort with
a formal thanks – something like “Silvermoon will remember this service.”
2. Honoring the Sunwell (Act III): The PC proves their reverence for Blood Elf culture by protecting9899

something sacred. Perhaps a plot arises where Alliance spies (or a rogue warlock) attempt to steal or
corrupt a fragment of the renewed Sunwell. The PC uncovers the plot and helps foil it, maybe by catching
the infiltrator in the Sunwell Plateau. Alternatively, the PC might retrieve a Sunfury relic – e.g. Anasterian’s
Tome or a destroyed guard’s insignia – from a battle site or an Alliance vault, returning it to Lor’themar. This shows the PC’s respect for Blood Elf heritage. Lor’themar is deeply moved (in his reserved way)
that someone outside (if the PC is) took such care. He might show the PC a private moment of emotion, like
a quiet tour of the Sunwell itself as a reward (which is a rare honor).
3. Voice of Reason (Act IV, Horde Council): During the tensions in the Horde as Sylvanas’s leadership
fractures, the PC defends Lor’themar’s cautious, honor-driven stance. For instance, at a Horde war council,
Sylvanas or her loyalists demand the Blood Elves send all their troops on a suicidal offensive. The PC speaks
up to support Lor’themar’s objections, persuading others (maybe even convincing Baine or Thalyssra to also
speak) that the plan is flawed. By publicly having Lor’themar’s back when he challenges Sylvanas,
the PC shows personal loyalty to him. This is dangerous and wins Lor’themar’s respect – he knows who will
stand with him if the Horde fractures. This likely fills the trust clock. 
Completion: With full trust, Lor’themar confides in the PC more openly. He might share his private doubts
about Sylvanas or his hopes for the Horde’s future without her. He could even ask the PC’s advice on a
delicate matter (for example, how to approach talks with the Alliance after the war, given the Night Warrior
Tyrande’s anger). A concrete sign of trust: Lor’themar performs a farstrider’s salute to the PC (an honor not
lightly given) or declares them an honorary Sunfury Guard in a small ceremony. Reward: The PC
gains “Ally of the Farstriders” as an aspect. They can invoke this for +2 on rolls involving elven
scouting parties or diplomacy among elves (both Blood Elves and possibly allied Nightborne). For instance,
the PC could call on a unit of Farstrider rangers to assist in a future quest, or invoke the aspect to gain
credibility when negotiating with Lor’themar’s officers. Additionally, Lor’themar might personally teach the
PC an old archery technique or a spell from the Sunwell (depending on PC’s skillset): granting a custom
stunt or extra. (See Mentorship below for details.)
Bonding Arc (Mentorship/Training): Lor’themar, being a veteran ranger-captain and statesman, can
impart both martial skills and leadership lessons. Scenes might be:
- Phoenix Guard Training: Lor’themar invites the PC to train with his elite Farstrider archers on the Sunfury
Range. The PC participates in drills like shooting targets while on moving hawkstriders or coordinating
volleys in sync. Lor’themar oversees and even spars with the PC, trading bowshots (blunted arrows) in a
friendly competition. Mechanic: The PC earns “Sun-Fire Shot” stunt – once per scene, the PC can
spend a Fate point to Flashily create an advantage on an enemy called “Imbued by Sunfire.” This represents
the PC’s projectile (arrow, bullet, spell, etc.) marking the target with lingering solar flames, which an ally (or
the PC) can then exploit for +2 on the next hit. Essentially, Lor’themar taught the PC how to tag a
foe for focused fire, a classic Farstrider tactic.
- Arcane Strategy Session: In Silvermoon’s Royal Library, Lor’themar and the PC peruse maps of historic
battles and discuss strategy, possibly joined by Grand Magister Rommath or First Arcanist Thalyssra.
Lor’themar recounts the Troll Wars and the defense of Quel’Thalas, drawing lessons about when to stand
ground versus retreat. Effect: The PC gains “Farstrider’s Lore” stunt – once per session, the PC can
get +2 to any Lore or Clever roll about Azeroth’s history, magic, or military tactics, reflecting knowledge
passed down from Quel’Thalas’s annals. For example, they might recall a specific detail about a
magical plague when confronting one, because Lor’themar discussed Dar’Khan’s betrayal with them.
- Etiquette of Power: Over a finely brewed glass of arlok (Thalassian wine) or perhaps tea, Lor’themar talks
to the PC about the burdens of leadership and the mistakes of pride (like Kael’thas’s fall). This could happen
in a quiet moment at Warfang Hold or before a diplomatic meeting. Lor’themar imparts that sometimes not107

doing something (restraint) is the hardest test for a leader. Mechanic: The PC may claim an extra Fate point
once per session when they deliberately invoke a self-compel to act with honor or restraint rather than
aggression. In other words, if the PC chooses a course that upholds Lor’themar’s taught “noble
restraint” at a personal cost, the GM should reward them with a Fate point (above and beyond the normal
compel if appropriate). This is a meta-reward to encourage the player to sometimes emulate
Lor’themar’s judicious approach. For a more direct in-game stunt: “Noble Restraint” – the PC can once per
scenario automatically succeed at a Will save against provocation or bloodlust by recalling Lor’themar’s
advice (e.g. resisting a demon’s goading to anger). But the Fate point method might be simpler.
- Alliance of Elves: If the PC is involved in interactions between Nightborne (Thalyssra) and Blood Elves,
Lor’themar might include them in those cultural exchanges. For example, the PC could accompany
Lor’themar and Thalyssra on a tour of the Nightborne gardens or a Hunt for mana beasts. Through this, the
PC learns about the broader elven worldview of reclaiming lost glory. Benefit: The PC could get a minor
aspect “Kinship of the Shal’dorei and Sin’dorei” to invoke when dealing with either Nightborne or Blood
Elves diplomatically, as they’ve been seen alongside both leaders bonding. (This is more narrative, possibly
covered by being ally to both Thalyssra and Lor’themar if they do both quests.)
By the end of mentorship, Lor’themar considers the PC not just an ally but a personal friend. He might
share a rare moment of levity – perhaps telling a subtle joke (Lor’themar is known for a wry sense of humor
occasionally). If the PC asks, he could even divulge a bit about his personal life or hobbies (maybe his
fondness for poetry or a song from pre-Scourge Silvermoon). A sign of the depth of their bond could be
Lor’themar entrusting the PC with a message to someone dear – e.g. giving the PC a letter to deliver to
Halduron (his ranger-general friend) or even to an estranged family member if any (this is speculative as
lore doesn’t mention Lor’themar’s family). This would show he trusts the PC with personal matters beyond
duty.
Romance Arc: Unlikely. Lor’themar is technically single in BfA (his beloved, Lady Liadrin, was a close friend
but not a paramour in lore; he had a past love who died, mentioned in a short story, but it’s not widely
known). However, by late BfA/Shadowlands, it’s strongly implied Lor’themar and Thalyssra (Nightborne
leader) develop mutual feelings. In BfA’s timeframe, this is just budding via friendly banter. Given this
“ambiguous” romantic status, a PC romance is theoretically possible but would be very slow and subtle –
and likely not fruitful if Thalyssra and Lor’themar end up together as canon suggests. To respect lore: No
explicit romance from Lor’themar toward a PC. If a player character is a Blood Elf who shows interest,
Lor’themar would politely deflect, perhaps saying he has too many responsibilities and ghosts of the past. If
pressed, he might admit his heart “still aches for what was lost”, referencing either his past or hinting at a
blossoming care for Thalyssra. Essentially, the PC can become a close confidant, but Lor’themar will not
enter a romance. (If the GM chooses to ignore the Thalyssra pairing, they could allow a non-canon romance arc,
but we assume lore accuracy.) In summary: Romance: Not Seeking. Lor’themar remains devoted to duty and
(quietly) to a certain First Arcanist. He will not stray from those commitments.
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If the PC betrays the Blood Elves or the Horde in a way that harms
Quel’Thalas, Lor’themar’s reaction is stern and sorrowful. For example, if the PC (as Alliance) was involved in
an attack that devastated a Blood Elf outpost, or if a Horde PC supported Sylvanas’s war crime to the
detriment of Blood Elf lives (like using plague on an Alliance city which then invites retaliation on
Quel’Thalas), Lor’themar’s trust shatters. He may demand the PC’s exile from Quel’Thalas, or if extreme,
order their arrest. He would remove any boons given to them (perhaps ceremonially breaking the crest he
gave or taking back a gift). He could invoke “Broken Pact” as a compel on himself to sever ties
completely. If the betrayal aligns the PC with Sylvanas’s destructive faction, Lor’themar might ally117 118
119
120 121
120 122
18

with Baine, Thrall, and Jaina against the PC in the climax. For instance, he could be among those
confronting the PC in a final showdown, stating regretfully: “I had hoped we would stand together when this
war ended. I see now that hope was in vain.” An alternate scenario: If the PC publicly embarrassed Lor’themar
or caused him to lose face (like revealing a secret of his in front of Sylvanas to gain favor), Lor’themar would
not seek violent retribution but would from then on refuse any help. The PC would find the gates of
Silvermoon closed to them until they somehow atone. He might require the PC undergo a “Trial of the
Sunwell” – some risky quest or ritual – to prove their loyalty before forgiving them. This could be an
opening for a redemption side-quest if PC desires to fix things. 
Alternate outcome on a lesser note: If the PC never particularly engages Lor’themar’s content (maybe
focusing elsewhere), he remains somewhat distant. He’ll still coordinate as needed in the war, but he won’t
grant the special titles or items. In the final Horde Council formed after Sylvanas, if the PC didn’t earn his
trust, Lor’themar might exclude them from certain decisions or treat them as just another adventurer. 
Unique Rewards: Serving Lor’themar and Quel’Thalas comes with elegant, magical rewards:
- Sunwell Crest: A pendant with the symbol of the Sunwell, bestowed by Lor’themar. It’s infused
with the Light of the restored Sunwell. Mechanic: Invoke “Blood of Quel’Thalas” (the aspect of this pendant)
once per session to gain +2 on a Will (or Endurance) roll to resist fear, exhaustion, or despair. It’s as
if the pride of the High Elves, now Blood Elves, fills the PC with courage. Narratively, a warm golden glow
emanates from the pendant when used, heartening the wearer.
- Sunstrider’s Blade: An elegant elven rapier or longsword from Silvermoon’s vaults, said to be inscribed
with runes of flame (perhaps a relic of the Sunstrider royal guard). Aspect: “Blade of the Phoenix.”
When invoked, it grants +2 on a Flashy attack that aims to dazzle or outmaneuver an opponent.
For example, the PC could invoke it to execute a blindingly fast flourish, disarming or confusing the enemy
with the sword’s fiery trail. It plays to Blood Elf finesse and flair in combat.
- Stunt – Arcane Redirect: Taught by Lor’themar (and possibly Rommath’s input), the PC learns a trick to
redirect magical energy. Effect: Once per conflict, if the PC is a spellcaster (or wields an enchanted weapon),
they may add +2 to a defense roll when outnumbered by foes by narratively redirecting an incoming attack
toward another target or nullifying it with a counter-spell. For instance, if two enemies shoot spells,
the PC uses one’s energy to absorb the other’s, effectively shielding themselves. This reflects Lor’themar’s
battlefield cunning when surrounded.
- Aspect – “Friend of Silvermoon”: A culmination reward for major deeds in Lor’themar’s quests.
This aspect signifies the PC is honored in Silvermoon City. It grants +2 when invoking the favor of Blood Elf
society – whether that’s rallying Blood Elf archers to your cause, accessing exclusive magical research in
Silvermoon, or even invoking Sylvanas’s lingering respect (as in, few Forsaken or Horde would dare cross
someone dear to Silvermoon’s leader). It’s a broad aspect basically making the PC a celebrity in
Quel’Thalas. Narratively, their portrait might hang in a Silvermoon hall or their story is told alongside the
Farstriders’. 
(The catalogue continues in Part 2 with additional BfA-era NPCs, their personal questlines, and rewards...)
First Arcanist Thalyssra (Horde/Nightborne)
Psychological Profile: Thalyssra is the First Arcanist of Suramar and leader of the Nightborne elves. Having
led a rebellion to free her people from a tyrannical regime and the Legion’s clutches during the Legion
expansion, she enters BfA as a relatively new ally to the Horde. Thalyssra is elegant, wise, and carries the123 124

weight of an ancient city’s heritage on her shoulders. She values freedom, loyalty, and the rebirth of her
people. Motivated to secure a future for the Nightborne, she allies with the Horde out of gratitude to the
Blood Elves and out of necessity for protection. She is diplomatic and curious, eager to learn from others’
cultures (her friendship with Liadrin and even brief exchanges with Jaina in Nazjatar show this openness).
However, Thalyssra is no stranger to sorrow: she lost friends and saw her city starve during the Nightwell’s
crisis, and she personally had to kill fellow elves who sided with the Legion. Thus, she has scars of
leadership – resolve tempered by regret. Thalyssra’s personality is warm and regal; she often acts as a
mediator and voice of reason. In Nazjatar (Act V), she works closely with Lor’themar and even flirts lightly,
showing a charming side behind the formality. Her greatest fear might be failing her people again or
falling into the isolationism that almost destroyed Suramar. She’s driven to ensure the Nightborne are never
alone and desperate as they were under Elisande. She also feels a bit of an outsider among the Horde
initially, due to being from a once-isolated culture, so those who reach out to understand her earn her
appreciation. Thalyssra is a master of arcane magic, with unique spells like arcane illusions and a deep
understanding of ancient elven artifacts. She respects intelligence and bravery in others, and has little
patience for crude behavior or those who’d enslave or addict others (given her people’s history with the
Nightwell addiction). In summary, Thalyssra is gracious, astute, and compassionate, balancing the heavy
mantle of Suramar’s leadership with a hopeful vision of a connected future for her people.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept: “First Arcanist of Suramar – Reformed Rebel and Scholar.” Trouble: “Burdens of
Isolation and Addiction” – Thalyssra constantly fights the remnants of Suramar’s troubled legacy
(withdrawal from the Nightwell, distrust from outsiders, etc.), and she sometimes takes too much upon
herself fearing reliance on others. Other: “Grace of the Shal’dorei” (elegant, calculated, diplomatic) and
“Vengeance for a Broken Heart” (referring to her sorrow over those she lost and a resolve to never bow
again). Possibly also “Bonded in Blood and Wine” to represent her newfound camaraderie with the Blood
Elves (over arcwine and shared experiences). These capture her as a cultured magical leader with past
trauma guiding her actions.
- Approaches: Clever +4, Flashy +2, Careful +3, Quick +1, Forceful +1, Sneaky +0. (Thalyssra is exceedingly
clever, an accomplished strategist and mage. She is careful as well, having spent decades in a political
powder keg in Suramar – she measures her actions. She can be flashy with magic when needed,
demonstrating Suramar’s arcane splendor, but she doesn’t rely on brute force or physical quickness herself
– she usually has teleportation or illusions instead of speed or muscle. Sneaky isn’t her style; when she was
rebelling, she had others like Valtois for that. She herself was more the rallying figure and tactician.)
- Stunts: Arcane Illusionist – Thalyssra is adept at weaving illusions. Once per scene, she can Cleverly
create an advantage representing an illusion or magical distraction without a roll (automatic success unless
opposed by strong magic). For example, she might make phantasmal duplicates of allies, cloak a small
group in a glamor to appear as naga during Nazjatar infiltration, or conjure a false image of terrain to
mislead an enemy. Ancient Ward – Thalyssra can inscribe protective runes mid-battle. She gains +2 to
Carefully defend (for herself or an ally within reach) against magical attacks by throwing up a quick arcane
barrier of ancient Suramar design. Ren’dorei Resonance – (Reflecting the Nightborne’s adeptness with leyline
magic) Once per session, Thalyssra can tap into a ley line or magical font in the environment to supercharge
a spell effect without cost. This could allow her (or by extension an ally if she’s helping them) to achieve a
normally impossible magical feat briefly – e.g. mass teleport the entire party out of a collapsing cave, dispel
a usually indispellable curse, etc. (GM should treat it like one free use of a major ritual in a snap moment,
enabled by Thalyssra’s deep arcane connection).
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 2, Mental 4. (Thalyssra is not physically robust – she’s a mage leader –
20

but her mental fortitude after surviving withdrawal and civil war is high.) Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate
(4), Severe (6).
Trust-Building Questline: Thalyssra’s trust is earned by helping secure the Nightborne’s place in the Horde
and showing respect for Nightborne culture. It likely unfolds in Acts III–IV (after the Nightborne formally
join, and especially during shared campaigns like Nazjatar). Milestones:
1. Stabilizing the Nightwell (Act III): Although the Nightwell was transformed at Legion’s end, residual
arcane issues might persist. The PC aids Thalyssra in a ritual to stabilize Suramar’s ley lines or to purge a
demonic taint left in the catacombs. During this quest, perhaps some withered (mana-starved Nightfallen)
still lurk in the depths, and the PC shows compassion by capturing them humanely rather than killing them,
which Thalyssra notes. Alternatively, if the PC is Alliance (as a twist, since Nightborne are Horde, perhaps a
neutral meeting?), they might help save Suramar civilians from a catastrophe, proving to Thalyssra that not
all outsiders are enemies. In any case, by protecting Suramar or furthering its restoration, the PC earns
Thalyssra’s gratitude. She might toast the PC with a glass of arcwine in the Lunastre Estate after the success,
marking the first spark of trust.
2. Bridge Between Cultures (Act IV): The PC facilitates a meaningful exchange between the Nightborne
and another group. For example, in the war, the Nightborne and Blood Elves deepen their bond – the PC
could deliver a relic from Silvermoon to Thalyssra as a gesture from Lor’themar (e.g. a spellstone to help
regrow Suramar’s vineyards) or vice versa, bring a Suramarian artifact to share with the Horde. If the PC is a
spellcaster, Thalyssra might invite them to Suramar to demonstrate a bit of Nightborne magic to them, a
sign she considers them worthy pupil/friend. If not a caster, maybe the PC helps host a feast in Orgrimmar
where Thalyssra’s retinue shares arcwine and stories with orcs and trolls— bridging those cultural gaps. By
showing diplomatic finesse and genuine interest in Nightborne culture (perhaps the PC took time to learn a
Shalassian phrase or two, or praised the beauty of Suramar’s architecture), Thalyssra feels a kinship. This
fills another segment.
3. Voice of the Nightborne (Act IV, Horde rebellion): When Sylvanas’s regime turns oppressive (e.g.
executing dissenters like Baine), Thalyssra, like Lor’themar, is inclined to rebel. The PC can cement trust by
standing with Thalyssra in a crucial moment. For instance, during Baine’s rescue scenario: the PC aids
Thalyssra in casting the invisibility spell over the rescuers. Perhaps the PC covers Thalyssra from enemy
guards while she channels the spell, or retrieves the focusing crystal she needs. Success means Baine
saved, which is a bonding experience. In the confrontation after, if Sylvanas accuses Thalyssra of treason,
the PC verbally defends Thalyssra (“The First Arcanist sought justice, not betrayal!”) at personal risk.
Thalyssra sees this and knows the PC is a true friend to her people. 
Completion: Thalyssra’s full trust manifests in her treating the PC almost like a member of Suramar’s ruling
cadre. She may give them a formal Nightborne title (perhaps “Honorary Spellblade of Suramar” or
“Moonlight Champion” in their tongue). She confides in them about her hopes and fears, maybe telling
the PC about how she misses her old friend Elisande’s better days or how she worries whether joining the
Horde was right. Reward: The PC gains “Beloved of the Nightborne” aspect, which is invokable whenever
dealing with Nightborne or ancient elf matters. For example, if trying to negotiate with a reclusive Shal’dorei
spire that still doesn’t trust outsiders, invoking that aspect proves “Thalyssra trusts this person, so should
we.” It can also apply to accessing Suramar’s resources – perhaps the PC can call in a favor like a squad of
Nightborne Battle-Mages to assist in a later fight, or request a custom potion from Suramar’s alchemists.
Thalyssra may also gift a tangible Sigil of Suramar, a brooch or signet that marks the PC as a cherished ally.
(Mechanically, could grant a free invoke once per session on a magic-related roll, representing the wisdom of
Suramar at their disposal.) Also, since the Nightborne are known for their magical vineyards, she might give
the PC a cask of Arcwine – an elixir that, once per session, the PC can “drink” (or share) to recover a mild
21

consequence or gain +2 on the next Lore or Will roll (clearing the mind). It’s a quirky but flavorful reward,
literally.
Bonding Arc (Mentorship): Thalyssra can mentor the PC in arcane arts or leadership for a society re-
emerging from trauma. Scenes to illustrate their growing bond:
- The Spell of Sharing: Thalyssra teaches the PC an old Nightborne spell meant to allow small groups to
share sensations or thoughts (used in Suramar to coordinate illusions among many mages). In a quiet
evening in the Twilight Vineyards, she casts this with the PC, and for a moment the PC experiences the
ancient music and serene nights of pre-fall Suramar through Thalyssra’s memories, while Thalyssra feels the
PC’s own driving emotions. This intimate exchange bolsters empathy. Mechanic: The PC gains “Telepathic
Bond (limited)” – a stunt allowing them once per session to telepathically communicate a simple phrase or
image to allies (even if separated), as long as those allies are ones they have a strong bond with (the GM can
say it was because Thalyssra taught them how to link minds briefly). Not overpowered, but can be clutch for
coordination.
- Nightwell Theory: In the Nighthold, gazing at the dormant Nightwell, Thalyssra discusses the nature of
arcane addiction and balance. If the PC is magical, this is a treasure trove – she expounds on ley-lines, and
how the Nightborne managed to create a sustainable font. If the PC isn’t magical, she still tries to explain in
lay terms, emphasizing discipline over power. Effect: The PC gains a deeper understanding of magical
corruption and discipline. They get a stunt “Arcane Discipline” – +2 to resist any enchantment or addiction-
based compel/effect (like resisting a charm spell or a tempting magical power). Thalyssra’s personal
experience with overcoming the Nightwell’s hold becomes a lesson for the PC’s own willpower.
- Shal’dorei Tactics: Thalyssra runs a war simulation with the PC, perhaps using illusory projections of
Alliance and Horde units on a tabletop in Shal’Aran (the rebel hideout). She shows how a smaller, well-fed
(on mana) force can outmaneuver a larger brute-force army, recounting how the Nightborne insurgents
used guile against Elisande’s loyalists. The PC participates in these drills, making decisions and learning
from any missteps in a safe environment. Reward: The PC gains “Guerrilla Arcana” – a stunt that gives +2
when using Clever or Sneaky approach to create advantages on a battlefield (like setting up an ambush,
trap, or misdirection), reflecting the cunning tactics gleaned from Suramar’s civil war. If the PC isn’t one to
sneak, the bonus could be to Clever actions only, such as strategic planning mid-battle.
- Cultural Exchange (Elves of Two Worlds): Thalyssra might ask the PC to accompany her to a Blood Elf
ceremony – perhaps a remembrance at the Sunwell or a Lunarfestival style event in Suramar. Together they
experience each other’s cultures: maybe she takes the PC stargazing atop the Temple of Elune in Suramar
(the stars were hard to see under the dome, so now it’s precious to her), or she invites Liadrin and the PC to
a Nightborne dinner. Through these, the PC learns fine etiquette and also the heart of the Nightborne –
their love for art, their deep pain of 10,000 years isolation. Outcome: The PC can now seamlessly blend into
Nightborne society. They even pick up the language; the GM might allow the PC to be considered fluent in
Shalassian. This doesn’t have a direct bonus, but narratively it is huge – in any Nightborne setting, they
won’t be seen as outsider. Could be represented by an aspect “Suramar’s Own” to invoke for persuasion
among Nightborne.
Completing mentorship, Thalyssra perhaps does something very symbolic: She entrusts the PC with Oculus
of the Night – a small crystalline device used to send messages between Suramar and Silvermoon (sort of
like a magical communication stone). She says, “If ever you need us – or simply wish to share wisdom over a cup
of arcwine – use this. We are friends now, bonded by more than politics.” This effectively gives the PC a way to
contact her (GM can use for story seeds too). It signifies she views the PC nearly on peer level. If the PC is
ever in dire need, one could imagine Thalyssra opening a portal and stepping through to assist, if
dramatically appropriate and earned.
22

Romance Arc: Thalyssra’s romantic status in BfA is somewhat ambiguous. There are hints of mutual
attraction between her and Lor’themar (flirty jokes in Nazjatar and in short stories), which later become a
canonical relationship by the time of Shadowlands epilogue (“The Vow Eternal” short story reveals they’re
engaged). During BfA itself, however, this was not confirmed, just teased. Thus, a PC romance is theoretically
possible if one assumes she’s not yet committed – but any such arc must be handled delicately and likely
remain unfulfilled if one sticks to lore (since she ends up with Lor’themar). 
If a PC did pursue a romance, it would require exceptional rapport and likely that Lor’themar either doesn’t
express his feelings or the PC outshines him in Thalyssra’s eyes (a big feat!). Consider it an alternate path:
- Courtly Affection: The PC shows themselves not just as a warrior but as a cultured soul that appreciates
Suramar’s arts. Perhaps they compose (or find) a piece of poetry in Thalassian praising Suramar’s rebirth
and secretly dedicate it to Thalyssra. This moves her – she has not been courted with art in millennia. She
begins to see the PC under a softer light during their interactions.
- Emotional Support: If the PC is present during a moment of vulnerability (maybe Thalyssra mourning the
loss of First Arcanist Oculeth’s health or another Nightborne casualty in war), the PC provides comfort not as
a follower but as a dear friend. Thalyssra, normally poised, lets a few tears show and perhaps rests a hand
on the PC’s. A quiet bond deepens.
- Choosing Paths: By Act V, if romance is on track, Thalyssra might confide that she feels torn between duty
and personal feeling—maybe referencing Lor’themar indirectly (“The Regent Lord… he has been kind to me.
But I sense his heart lies in duty alone.”). The PC can choose to encourage her happiness (even if not with
them) or confess their own feelings. Should the PC profess love eloquently and sincerely, Thalyssra, though
touched, would likely respond thoughtfully: “In another time, perhaps I would walk that path with you… but for
now, let us cherish what we have.” This might translate to a gentle, possibly bittersweet relationship that
doesn’t fully blossom because of the war and her responsibilities. After the war, one could imagine an
epilogue where either the PC steps aside for Lor’themar’s canon romance, or in a non-canonical twist,
Thalyssra chooses the PC over him. 
Given lore, the safest answer: Thalyssra romance is possible but not resolved. The PC might earn an
aspect “Thalyssra’s Heart (Unspoken)” which could be invoked for aid or influence with her, but the actual
love remains mostly in subtext. The GM could allow one ephemeral moment, such as Thalyssra giving the
PC a soft kiss on the cheek under Suramar’s moon after a victory, thanking them for making her feel alive
again after thousands of years of numb duty – a fleeting romance that might or might not continue openly.
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If the PC betrays Thalyssra or the Nightborne, it’s akin to rekindling the
traumas of Elisande’s betrayal for her. Small betrayals, like breaking a promise to help Suramar or siding
with someone who insults the Nightborne publicly, will lead to Thalyssra withdrawing all trust. She might
politely cold-shoulder the PC and exclude them from Suramar affairs (no more arcwine invites). A major
betrayal (e.g. PC as Alliance sabotages a Horde mission causing Nightborne deaths, or a Horde PC sides
with Sylvanas in persecuting the Nightborne for disloyalty) will ignite Thalyssra’s wrath. She could label the
PC “d’vela” (traitor in Shalassian) and seek punitive justice. Perhaps she requests Lor’themar to allow
Nightborne enforcers to arrest or interrogate the PC. If open conflict arises, Thalyssra can be a formidable
opponent – imagine facing her weaving illusions and arcane torrents in Suramar’s streets, utilizing the city’s
defenses. The PC would have lost not only an ally but gained a powerful enemy. On the narrative side,
Suramar would be closed off to them; any allied Nightborne would cease cooperation. They’d effectively cut
off an entire faction’s support. Redemption would be hard – maybe if the PC later does something
monumental for the Nightborne (like saving the Sunwell which the Nightborne now draw some power
23

from), she might reconsider. Short of that, the PC’s name would be cursed in Suramar’s history archives as
just another outsider who betrayed them.
Alternate: If the PC simply never engages with Thalyssra (say they ignore her presence), then she remains
cordial but distant – the Horde PC will have her as a distant leader who coordinates via Lor’themar. The
Alliance PC may only meet her in battle context. Her personal quests wouldn’t be triggered, and she’d just
be an acquaintance with no strong feelings towards the PC.
Unique Rewards: A close bond with Thalyssra yields arcane-enriched rewards:
- Arcanist’s Mantle: A flowing Nightborne cloak, woven with enchanted duskweave and threads from the
Nightwell’s essence. Aspect: “Cloak of the Nightborne.” The PC can invoke it to blend into magical
environments or resist harmful magic. Once per session, it grants +2 to Sneak when in dim or arcane-lit
settings (as it shimmers to match surroundings), or +2 to defend against a magical attack by momentarily
phase-shifting the wearer out of sync (like a blink). This item reflects the Nightborne’s mastery of
concealment and arcane defense.
- Crystal of Zin-Azshari: A brilliant violet crystal Thalyssra recovered from the ruins of Zin-Azshari (ancient
Night Elf capital). She gifts it to the PC, attuned to respond to their mana. Mechanic: The PC can tap the
Crystal of Zin-Azshari to empower a spell or item. This functions as an Extra that allows one of two effects
per session: recharge one spent Fate point (as if drawing power from it) or invoke the crystal’s aspect “Echo
of the Night Empire” for +2 on any action involving ancient magic or knowledge (e.g., deciphering old
runes, casting a spell of Highborne origin, etc.). Essentially a small reservoir of arcane energy the PC carries.
- Arcanist’s Owl – Thalyssra could entrust the PC with a trained arcane familiar, an owl construct (like those
that perched in Suramar’s trees). This owl doesn’t fight but serves as a scout and messenger. In game terms,
it might grant an advantage “Eyes of the Arcanist” which the PC can invoke to notice hidden things or send
messages over distance (the owl can carry a short written message and blink to a known location). It’s a
roleplay-rich reward, emphasizing trust (familiars are often considered extensions of the mage’s own self).
- Mount: Manasaber – Perhaps the crowning gift: a Nightborne manasaber, those sleek panthers formed of
condensed magical energy. If the PC has proven a true friend, Thalyssra could present them with a newly
conjured manasaber cub to raise. This mount, once grown, crackles with blue arcane lines. It allows the PC
to traverse great distances swiftly (on par with magical teleportation mounts). Mechanically, beyond being a
mount, it might allow once-per-session an Arcane Leap – effectively letting the PC narratively teleport short
range (a few hundred feet) by riding the manasaber as it blinks. This could be invoked to escape an
enclosure or bypass a barrier creatively. It’s akin to what Nightborne NPCs use in game as mounts and
would be a sign to all: the Nightborne consider this hero one of their own.
- Title: “Moonfriend of Suramar” – If not romance, at least a title. The PC’s name is inscribed in Suramar’s
records as a trusted ally. Perhaps a wine in their honor is named in the vineyard (the “<Name> Reserve”).
The title itself is mostly honorific, but NPC Nightborne react very favorably. If the PC ever needed to recruit
Nightborne forces or request aid, the bureaucrats of Suramar would expedite it, thanks to their Moonfriend.
Essentially, any social roll involving Nightborne has a baseline +2 circumstance bonus without even needing
an invoke, because their reputation precedes them. (To keep mechanical consistency, we can say that’s just
invoking the aspect Beloved of Nightborne proactively, but it’s so ingrained it might not cost a Fate point at
GM’s discretion for minor favors.)137 138

Lady Liadrin (Horde/Blood Elf)
Psychological Profile: Lady Liadrin is the matriarch of the Blood Knights, the order of Blood Elf paladins.
Once a high priestess of the Light, she became disillusioned after Quel’Thalas fell to the Scourge, and for a
time she led the Blood Knights in siphoning holy power from a captive naaru (a dark chapter she later
atoned for). By the BfA era, Liadrin has rekindled her faith genuinely after the Sunwell’s restoration, and she’s an unwavering champion of the Light and the Horde. Liadrin’s personality is disciplined,
fervent, and maternal towards her people. She carries guilt for the extremes she went to in order to
empower the Blood Knights (draining a naaru), and as a result she is both humble and zealous – humble in
acknowledging past wrongs, zealous in ensuring the safety and honor of the Blood Elves going forward.
She has a strong moral core but it’s firmly steeped in the Blood Elves’ perspective; she believes in
defending Quel’Thalas at any cost and repaying the Horde’s support (since the Horde accepted the Blood
Elves when the Alliance didn’t, historically). Liadrin can be very stern and no-nonsense – she doesn’t
tolerate cowardice or sloppiness. But to the innocent and the loyal, she shows great compassion and
protectiveness. Deep down, Liadrin fears failing the Light again or leading her knights astray. She is driven
by devotion: to the Light, to Regent Lord Lor’themar, and to the memory of those lost (like her trainees slain
by undead, which initially fueled her rage). In BfA, she takes part in battles like the Siege of Lordaeron and
the war campaign, often as a field commander of Blood Elf paladins. She respects honorable warriors even
among enemies, but despises undead Scourge and those who use dishonorable tactics (she’s not a fan of
Sylvanas’s use of blight or raising undead, for instance, though she stays loyal to the Horde). As for personal
life, Liadrin is mostly portrayed as a single-minded leader; there’s no canonical romance for her, which
leaves it open but given her responsibilities, she likely hasn’t pursued any. She interacts respectfully with
Turalyon and Fareeya (Alliance paladins) in Legion, showing she can set aside old grudges for the greater
good. In summary, Liadrin is a battle-hardened paladin seeking redemption through service, combining the
fierce warrior ethos of the Blood Elves with a re-embraced holy righteousness.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept: “Blood Knight Matriarch – Blade of the Light for Silvermoon.” Trouble: “Haunted by
Past Zealotry” – Liadrin is troubled by her past actions (stealing the Light, almost losing her way),
and this can lead her to be overly hard on herself or others. Other: “Redeemed by the Light” (having found
true faith and balance again) and “Lioness of Quel’Thalas” (fiercely protective leader). These capture her
redemption arc, pious ferocity, and lingering guilt.
- Approaches: Forceful +3, Careful +2, Flashy +2, Clever +1, Quick +1, Sneaky +0. (Liadrin fights and leads
forcefully – she’s inspiring in direct action. She has a disciplined tactical mind ( Careful planning and
formation tactics) and can be Flashy in that she often leads from the front with bold proclamations (“For the
Sunwell!”). She’s not particularly subtle ( Sneaky 0 ); she’s upfront in her approach. Quick and Clever are
decent; she’s experienced but not known for trickery or extreme agility – she wears plate armor after all.)
- Stunts: Silvermoon’s Zeal – When Liadrin fights undead or demons (foes of the Light), she gains +2 to
Forcefully attack once per scene. This reflects her blade (a runeblade) being especially effective,
possibly literally burning such creatures with holy fire. Light’s Retribution – If Liadrin or an ally within her
sight suffers a significant injury, Liadrin can once per conflict Flashily unleash a shockwave of Light,
automatically creating an advantage like “Blinding Aegis” or “Holy Shockwave” on nearby enemies (free
invoke for allies to capitalize). This represents her passionate response to seeing her people hurt – a burst
of Light that staggers foes. Aura of Sanctity – Liadrin’s faith manifests as a constant aura. Allies near her
(including the PC) gain +1 to defend against fear or shadow magic. (Mechanically, treat it as if once per
scene, an ally can reroll a failed defense against a fear/dark effect by invoking her aura for free, since she
bolsters them.) This is more passive but fits her role as a paladin leader buffing her troops.139 140

- Stress & Consequences: Physical 4, Mental 3. (She is a seasoned frontline fighter in heavy armor – she can
take a beating physically. Mentally she’s strong-willed but not as high as some like Anduin or Thalyssra
because she still has some trauma that can be exploited perhaps. Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate (4),
Severe (6).)
Trust-Building Questline: To gain Liadrin’s trust, a PC must demonstrate honor, valor, and dedication to
protecting the innocent (especially Blood Elf lives). Liadrin is wary of those who show cruelty or those who
might repeat her past mistakes. Milestones:
1. Protect the Weak (Act I/II): Early in the war, perhaps during the evacuation of Lordaeron or a skirmish in
Hillsbrad, the PC has an opportunity to save wounded Blood Elf refugees or young trainees from danger. If
the PC puts themselves at risk to shield others – for example, carrying an injured Blood Elf ranger out of a
collapsing building while under fire – Liadrin witnesses this or hears of it. She values such
selflessness greatly. This starts her respect. She might approach the PC after the battle, clasp their arm and
say, “The Blood Knights could use more like you.” A checkbox ticks on the trust clock.
2. Relic of the Light (Act II/III): Liadrin tasks the PC with a quest to retrieve or safeguard a holy object
significant to the Blood Knights. Perhaps the Tome of Remembrance, a book listing all fallen Blood
Knights, was lost in a skirmish with Alliance spies or stolen by a renegade undead. The PC tracks it down
(maybe in Stromgarde or in an Auction in Booty Bay) and recovers it. Alternatively, the PC uncovers a cache
of tainted crystals (remnants from when the Blood Knights drained the naaru) and brings them to Liadrin for
proper disposal, rather than exploiting them. By handling such a sensitive matter with integrity, the PC shows
Liadrin that they honor the Blood Knights’ history and redemption. She’s impressed and possibly a bit relieved (“I
feared others might seek to use these for power… thank you for proving my fears unfounded.”).
3. Stand Your Ground (Act IV, during internal Horde conflict): * Liadrin, as a staunch believer in honor, quietly
sides with Saurfang/Baine’s ideals over Sylvanas’s cruelty, though she remains duty-bound until Sylvanas’s
betrayal is clear. In a critical moment – say, when Sylvanas orders something heinous like executing
prisoners or blighting a town – the PC openly refuses and perhaps tries to stop it, and Liadrin either
witnesses or hears of this principled stand. For example, if Sylvanas commanded the raising of fallen
Alliance soldiers as undead, the PC might sabotage the necromancy. Liadrin would secretly approve
because it aligns with the Light’s mercy, even though disobeying the Warchief is risky. When Sylvanas flees
after killing Saurfang, Liadrin is among those reaffirming the Horde’s honor. She remarks to the PC that
their actions during the war showed true honor. Trust clock fills. 
Completion: With full trust, Liadrin regards the PC as one of her own knights (even if the PC isn’t a paladin).
She might ceremonially make them an Honorary Blood Knight in a small ceremony at the Sunfury Spire in
Silvermoon. In that ceremony, she could present them with a Blood Knight tabard or a shard of the renewed
Sunwell as a token. Reward: The PC gains the aspect “Champion of the Blood Knights” (or “Anointed by
Lady Liadrin”). This can be invoked for +2 whenever the PC leads or inspires troops in battle in the name of
honor, or when interacting with any Argent Crusade or Sunwalker (Tauren paladin) types who respect
Liadrin. It’s effectively a mark of high esteem among all who value the Light on Horde side, and even some
Alliance paladins might give the PC the benefit of the doubt (perhaps allowing parley rather than attacking
on sight, etc.). Also, Liadrin may grant a Blessing of the Blood Oath: once per session, if the PC is about to
fall in battle, a burst of holy energy (residual from Liadrin’s blessing) keeps them standing with 1 stress box
– essentially a second wind. (Narratively, maybe they recall Liadrin’s words and refuse to yield, the Light
within them blazes one more time.)
Bonding Arc (Mentorship/Training): If the PC is a paladin or warrior, they benefit greatly from Liadrin’s
training; if not, Liadrin can still teach discipline, strategy, and faith. Scenes could be:144 145
26

- The Silvermoon Drill: Liadrin runs the PC through a classic Blood Knight training session in Silvermoon’s
Plaza. This includes formation fighting, shield techniques, and defending a comrade. Mechanic: The PC gains
“Blood Knight’s Discipline” stunt – once per conflict, when the PC is fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with an
ally (literally adjacent in melee), they gain +2 to Carefully defend an attack aimed at either of them
(basically covering each other). This instills coordinated defense tactics.
- Lessons of the Light: In the rebuilt Sunwell chamber, Liadrin guides the PC in a meditative prayer. Even if
the PC isn’t a paladin, feeling the warmth of the Sunwell can strengthen their spirit. Perhaps a vision of a
naaru or of a serene golden field appears. Liadrin’s gentle side shows here as she speaks of forgiveness and
purpose. Effect: The PC gets an aspect “Touched by the Sunwell” which they can invoke to resist shadow
magic or emotional despair. Also, if the PC has any lingering magical afflictions (curse, etc.), this could
cleanse it as a narrative bonus.
- War Council Wisdom: Liadrin includes the PC in a tactical meeting with Blood Knight captains. They plan
an upcoming strike (maybe retaking a forward post in Arathi). She encourages the PC to propose a plan. If
the PC’s plan is good and they lead the mission, Liadrin’s faith in them grows. Reward: The PC picks up
“Tactician of the Light” – a stunt granting +2 to Cleverly create advantage when surveying a battlefield or
positioning allies before a fight (like choosing terrain or noticing enemy weak points). It’s essentially military
strategy training from a veteran general.
- Heart-to-Heart: By a quiet evening campfire in a warzone (let’s say in Zuldazar after a tough fight), Liadrin
and the PC talk about personal burdens. Liadrin might share how she mourns the priest she used to be, or
how she visits the graves of her fallen knights. She imparts the lesson that showing emotion isn’t weakness,
and that guilt can be a motivator if not allowed to fester. The PC can share something of their past too.
Outcome: The PC and Liadrin form a genuine friendship beyond superior-subordinate. The PC might
henceforth be comfortable reminding Liadrin to rest or delegate when she overworks (and she’ll actually
listen, which shocks others!). No direct mechanic, but it humanizes her in the PC’s eyes and vice versa –
which might be the difference if say the PC later has to snap Liadrin out of a moment of fanatic rage (not
common for her in current times, but if something like the Sunwell got threatened, she might get tunnel
vision and the PC’s word could bring her back).
After training, Liadrin likely invites the PC to a ceremony in the Blood Knight order – maybe the
inauguration of new Blood Knights. She has the PC stand at her side as an honored guest while she knights
recruits with a Light-blessed sword. This public recognition is huge – every Blood Knight sees that <Name> is
effectively Liadrin’s right hand friend. The PC might even get to say a few words to the recruits (if they do,
Liadrin smiles approvingly). 
Romance Arc: Liadrin has no known canonical romantic attachments, and nothing explicitly bars it aside
from her being very mission-focused. She’s not immortal like elves used to be (Blood Elves are mortal, but
long-lived), so she could have love interests, but she hasn’t shown any on screen. If a PC endeared
themselves through the trust and bonding arcs, a romance is conceivable – albeit one that would be
defined by mutual respect and quiet moments rather than overt flirtation. How it might go:
- The PC spends a lot of time with Liadrin on and off the battlefield, developing a camaraderie. The first hint
of deeper feelings might come during a near-death experience: maybe the PC is badly injured protecting
Liadrin. As she heals them with the Light, her usual stoic expression breaks, showing fear of losing them.
She might squeeze their hand after stabilizing them, whispering “Don’t you dare fall, not after all we’ve been
through.”
- Later, in a peaceful interlude (perhaps after the war, at a remembrance ceremony for the fallen), Liadrin
and the PC share a drink of Blood Elven wine. Liadrin, not one to indulge, nevertheless opens up – she
thanks the PC for reminding her what it means to live, not just fight. The conversation might lead to Liadrin
27

admitting that she’s largely given her life to the order, but recent events made her realize she doesn’t want
to have only duty to comfort her in old age. Her eyes meet the PC’s when she says this – it’s as close to a
vulnerable confession as she manages.
- If the PC reciprocates, acknowledging how much her friendship (or more) means, Liadrin would likely
respond with something like a solemn vow: “Whatever tomorrow brings, you have my loyalty… and my heart.”
It’s a very knightly declaration of love. She might not be flowery, but she’s earnest. A possible culminating
moment: at the Sunwell under its golden light, Liadrin presents the PC with a Blood Knight insignia forged
into a locket, and inside is a tiny shard of the Sunwell crystal. She says this belongs with them now. It’s
almost like a proposal equivalent for her order. 
A romance with Liadrin would be marked by deep mutual support. Benefits: The PC might get the Aspect
“Heart of the Blood Knight Matriarch.” Invoking it could give +2 on any rallying or morale-boosting action
for allies – because seeing the PC and Liadrin’s strong bond inspires those under them (a symbol of hope
and unity). Also, no one in Silvermoon would dare disrespect the PC – socially, they’d be seen as family of
one of Quel’Thalas’s great heroes. In a more personal mechanical benefit, Liadrin could create a Bond of
Retribution: once per session, if the PC is gravely harmed, Liadrin can appear in narrative (if feasible) to
smite their foe or at least her spirit bolsters the PC to fight on (much like a GM free invoke to turn the tides).
Essentially, they fight as one soul in two bodies at times. 
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If the PC somehow turned against the Blood Elves or abused the Light,
Liadrin’s reaction would be intense disappointment and anger. For instance, if an Alliance PC led a strike
that killed many Blood Elf civilians or a Horde PC committed a war crime Liadrin finds abhorrent (like
slaughtering surrendering enemies or, Light forbid, working with undead Scourge), Liadrin would confront
them directly. She might demand they face justice under Horde law, or if beyond redemption, she might
challenge them to combat. Liadrin does not relish killing former allies, but she would if she believed the PC
had fallen to true darkness (like a paladin turned Death Knight scenario). 
If the PC had been like a student to her, this would mirror her feelings about some of her students who died
or turned – it’s personal. She might shout during the fight things like “I taught you better than this!” If the PC
shows any contrition, she’d rather capture and redeem them than execute (reflecting her belief in
redemption, since she herself was redeemed). Perhaps imprisonment and a chance at atonement could be
an arc (GM could allow the PC to earn her forgiveness through a quest, e.g., purifying a desecrated chapel
or saving a group of children from undead, something to prove the Light’s still with them). Without
atonement, Liadrin will permanently rescind any honors: the PC’s Blood Knight sigil stripped, their name
blacklisted in Silvermoon. The aspect “Champion of the Blood Knights” would flip to a compel liability
“Disgraced in Blood Knights’ Eyes.” 
Alternate scenario: If the PC simply drifts away or doesn’t strongly engage with Liadrin’s story, she remains
polite but distant. After the war, she’s busy rebuilding. The PC is just another adventurer to her, maybe with
a nod of thanks for fighting in the war. They wouldn’t gain special items or rank. She might be a source of
quests rather than an ally who vouches for them. Essentially, they miss out on an influential friend in the
Horde.
Unique Rewards: Through Liadrin, the PC can receive powerful relics of the Blood Knights and Alliance-of-
Light:
- Blood Knight Warblade: A two-handed sword or polearm engraved with the Blood Knight order’s insignia.
Forged with Sunwell-infused steel. Aspect: “Blade of Blood and Light.” The PC can invoke it to deal significant
28

extra damage to undead or shadow creatures (+2 on attacks vs. such) or to create a “Sanctified Wound”
aspect on any enemy (meaning the wound from this blade cannot be easily healed by dark magic). Liadrin
awards this saying it was once held by one of her mentors, now it’s the PC’s honor to carry it.
- Scion’s Crest: A shield (if the PC uses one) or a amulet if not, bearing Liadrin’s personal crest. Mechanic:
Once per scene, the PC can invoke “Liadrin’s Aegis” to nullify a single instance of damage from an attack –
essentially a free full defend that completely blocks an attack as the shield/amulet flares with Light. Perhaps
it can only do that when the PC is acting to protect others (to encourage heroic use). It’s like having a
miracle block when it really counts.
- Warhorse: Thalassian Charger – If the PC doesn’t already have a signature mount, Liadrin can arrange
one of the Blood Knight chargers, barded in red and gold, to be gifted. This steed is fearless and trained to
battle undead and demons without panicking. It may have an aspect “Devoted Charger of Silvermoon” that
the PC can invoke to ride through hazardous terrain or trample lesser foes. Even outside mechanics, it’s a
symbol that the PC rides as a true knight of Silvermoon.
- Elixir of Sunwell – Vials of blessed water drawn from the Sunwell’s basin (just a small vial). When
consumed, it invigorates body and soul. Game-wise, maybe limited use (like 3 charges). Each use could fully
restore the PC’s physical stress track and erase a Mild physical consequence (healing) or grant a +2 on all
attack and defense rolls for one scene (as if imbued with radiant energy). This is akin to a super-potion only
given to greatest heroes. Liadrin entrusts a few to the PC for when things look dire. Such potent Light magic
could even burn undead that come too near the PC while it’s active, etc. Use sparingly and dramatically.
- Allied Aspect – “Hero of the Light”: Not just among Blood Elves, but across the Horde (and maybe
Alliance) those in the know have heard of the PC’s deeds with Liadrin. The PC can invoke Hero of the Light
for social sway among any Light-fearing folk – Argent Crusaders, priests, commoners who worship the
Light. Even some Alliance might respect the title if politics don’t override it. It’s like being a paladin of legend
status. Conversely, enemies like undead or Shadow cultists might specifically target the PC (GM could
compel it as a drawback when, say, a demon senses the PC’s radiant reputation and goes after them). 
(The catalogue would continue with any other NPC entries such as Princess Tess Greymane, Alleria Windrunner,
Baine Bloodhoof, Valeera Sanguinar, Shandris Feathermoon, and Princess Talanji in a similar format, embedding
each into the BfA narrative and providing their questlines and rewards. Due to length, those entries are omitted
here, but the above examples illustrate the format and approach for each.)
