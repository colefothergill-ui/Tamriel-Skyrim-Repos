World of Warcraft: BFA – Personal Questlines
(Companion NPCs III)
Overview: This third compendium adds seven lore-accurate NPC allies into the Battle for Azeroth Fate Core
campaign, expanding on Parts I & II. Each NPC section below mirrors the narrative tone and interlinked
format of previous BFANpcs PDFs, integrating their personal quest arcs seamlessly into the main story Acts.
These questlines unfold alongside canon events (Acts I–V), rather than as separate side-quests, to deepen
immersion and player choice. As before, each NPC entry includes a psychological profile, Fate stat block
(Fate Accelerated style Approaches, Aspects, Stunts, Stress), a trust-building quest arc, a mentorship/
bonding arc, an optional romance arc if lore-appropriate, and the rewards (Aspects, Stunts, boons, unique
gear, mounts, or titles) for developing these relationships. GM guidance is provided to weave these NPCs
into scenes where they canonically appear, offering branching outcomes (loyalty, betrayal, rivalry, even love)
based on player decisions. Use these to enrich the campaign’s emotional depth and give PCs lasting bonds
with Azeroth’s heroes.
Nathanos Blightcaller (Horde)
Psychological Profile: Nathanos Blightcaller is the relentless champion of the Banshee Queen. In life he
was Nathanos Marris, the only human ever trained as a Farstrider ranger lord by Sylvanas herself. In
undeath, his loyalty to Sylvanas is absolute – Sylvanas’s will is his purpose. He is cold, sarcastic, and
battle-hardened, viewing mercy as weakness. Yet beneath his caustic exterior, he harbors a fierce, forbidden
love for Sylvanas Windrunner. Her desires are his driving force, and he measures all others against her.
Nathanos takes grim pride in executing her commands with efficiency and brutality. He relishes the war’s
bloodshed, confident in the Horde’s supremacy, but secretly worries as Sylvanas’s tactics grow ever darker
(he was even uneasy with the extent of the blight and genocide). Still, he buries any doubts beneath
scorn for the Alliance and anyone who questions his queen. He fears nothing for himself (having already
died), but fears losing Sylvanas or failing her in the end. In War of Thorns and the Fourth War, Nathanos is
omnipresent – directing assaults, slaying Alliance commanders, and ensuring Sylvanas’s plans are carried
out. To allies he’s an intimidating taskmaster; to enemies, a mocking villain. Only the PCs’ extraordinary
deeds might earn a shred of his respect. And even then, any “trust” would be laced with ulterior motives, for
Nathanos trusts no one except Sylvanas.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept – “Champion of the Banshee Queen” (elite undead ranger, Sylvanas’s right hand).
Trouble – “Bound by Love and Duty” (fanatically devoted to Sylvanas, at the expense of all else). Other Aspects
– “Dark Vengeance Incarnate” (embodiment of Forsaken retribution) and “Every Waking Moment for Her”
(personal feelings drive his loyalty). These capture his deadly skills, unwavering devotion, and simmering
wrath.
- Approaches: Forceful +3, Quick +3, Sneaky +2, Careful +1, Clever +1, Flashy +0. (As a ranger, Nathanos
strikes swiftly and relentlessly. He is equally comfortable fighting head-on or laying ambushes with cunning.
He isn’t one for flamboyance or diplomacy – his words bite, not charm.)
- Stunts: Fury of the Blightcaller: Once per scene Nathanos can mark a target for death – he Flashily1

creates an advantage “ Marked by the Blightcaller ” on an enemy, giving him +2 on his next attack against
that foe (reflecting his lethal focus). Unliving Senses: Nathanos’s undead vigilance negates the
usual edge of a surprise attack – he gains +2 to Carefully defend against ambushes or hidden foes, as he is
never truly caught off guard. Barbed Insult: His caustic tongue can Forcefully create an advantage
“Shaken by Scorn ” once per session – demoralizing a foe (imposing a free invoke against that enemy) if
they are susceptible to intimidation.
- Stress & Consequences: 3 physical, 3 mental. Consequence slots: Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6). (As an
undead, he feels dulled pain and emotion – hard to faze physically or mentally. However, invoking Sylvanas
or his past can still unnerve him.)
Trust-Building Questline: Gaining Nathanos’s “trust” is a grim endeavor – it’s more about proving one’s
utility and loyalty to Sylvanas’s cause. This questline is best suited for Horde PCs (Alliance PCs will find
Nathanos only as an adversary or at best a temporary uneasy ally). Key milestones include: 
Blood in the Ashes (Act I – War of Thorns): During the Burning of Teldrassil, the PC carries out a
ruthless task that Nathanos assigns – for example, hunting down fleeing Darnassian scouts or
securing an Alliance deserter who knew too much. If the PC completes the duty without hesitation
or mercy, Nathanos notes their efficiency. He might grunt, “Not bad… for a living,” acknowledging
their value. However, if the PC shows mercy (like sparing a target against orders), Nathanos will
report this weakness (a setback to trust, possibly requiring the PC to later prove themselves in an
even harsher task). 
The Warchief’s Weapon (Act II – War Campaign): As the war progresses, Nathanos entrusts the PC
with a critical mission behind enemy lines – e.g. infiltrating an Alliance hold to assassinate a
strategist or retrieve an Azerite war machine component. This is presented as a test of loyalty. 
Success: The PC accomplishes the mission cleanly, maybe even eliminating extra targets of
opportunity. Nathanos greets them with a cold, approving smirk, perhaps even saying, “The Dark
Lady will be pleased. You’ve done well… for now.” Failure or Refusal: If the PC balks or fails,
Nathanos’s lip curls in disdain. He’ll sneer that the PC is disappointing and not to be trusted with
important work (trust clock stalls or regresses, and he gives them only menial tasks thereafter). 
Shadows of Treachery (Act III – The Rebel Hunt): In the lead-up to Sylvanas’s endgame, Nathanos
grows suspicious of Saurfang’s and Baine’s rebels. He “invites” the PC to root out betrayers in their
ranks. If the PC remains loyal to Sylvanas: they might uncover a rebel meetup in Orgrimmar –
delivering a fellow Horde dissenter (perhaps an NPC they know) to Nathanos’s awaiting blades. This
chilling act proves the PC’s allegiance. Nathanos actually offers a rare compliment, calling them an
“asset to the Dark Lady.” If instead the PC’s sympathies lie with Saurfang: they might deceive Nathanos
or feed him half-truths. In this case, he senses something amiss – perhaps setting a trap to test the
PC. (GM note: If the PC is double-dealing here, a dramatic scene might occur where Nathanos
confronts them with evidence of their contact with Baine’s allies. The PC must decide to double-down
on loyalty to Sylvanas – perhaps by attacking a rebel NPC ally in front of Nathanos – or reveal their
defiance and face Nathanos’s wrath.) 
When the Trust clock fills, Nathanos’s “approval” manifests as a grudging recognition. If the PC stayed
fiercely loyal: Nathanos informs Sylvanas of their service. The PC is rewarded by the Banshee Queen
herself in a dark ceremony. Reward: The PC gains the Aspect “Favored of the Dark Lady” – invokable for
+2 whenever acting in Sylvanas’s interests or commanding Forsaken units (Sylvanas’s open backing gives
them clout). Nathanos also begrudgingly shares tactical info with the PC; for instance, he might
brief them on the timing of Sylvanas’s next strike, effectively giving the PC a free invoke of “Forewarned by56

Nathanos” in the next major battle. In narrative terms, the PC becomes Nathanos’s go-to “hound” for lethal
missions. 
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If the PC turns against Sylvanas (e.g. siding with Saurfang’s rebellion in Act III),
Nathanos immediately labels them traitor. In the Battle for Orgrimmar climax, he will seek out the PC on the
battlefield with vengeful intent. The GM can narrate a tense encounter: perhaps as Saurfang challenges
Sylvanas, Nathanos intercepts the PC to prevent them from aiding the rebels. A duel ensues – Nathanos
invoking “Dark Vengeance Incarnate” against the PC. Outcome if PC prevails: If the PC defeats Nathanos
(driving him off or wounding him) it’s a huge moral victory; Nathanos spits that “ This isn’t over… ” and later
flees with Sylvanas. The PC earns the enmity of the Blightcaller going into any post-war epilogue (he could
become a recurring antagonist, plotting revenge even after Sylvanas’s exile). Outcome if PC falters:
Nathanos may grievously wound the PC with a poisoned arrow, forcing them to retreat or nearly killing
them, snarling that their “ betrayal will be repaid in blood. ” In either case, trust is obviously shattered. There is
no reconciliation – if the PC didn’t stay loyal, Nathanos concludes they were never worthy. (Should the PC
somehow try to appeal to Nathanos’s better nature – e.g. arguing Sylvanas is harming the Horde – it falls on
deaf ears; he is impervious to such persuasion, compelled by love and duty.) The only sliver of silver
lining: if the PC was very close to earning his trust before betraying, Nathanos might, in a final act of twisted
respect, let the PC live with a warning rather than outright executing them. This could manifest as the GM
allowing the PC to escape the duel with a moderate consequence (“Marked by the Blightcaller” – a scar or
curse) rather than death, implying Nathanos wants them alive to suffer later.
Bonding Arc (Mentorship & Rivalry): True friendship is beyond Nathanos – but a PC who has proven
themselves might enter a sort of mentor–protégé or rivals dynamic. Once the PC is an established “asset,”
Nathanos might share some of his ranger expertise in terse, begrudging lessons: 
“Hunt as One” – Lethal Training: Nathanos takes the PC on a night-time stalking through the
woods of Ashenvale or Tiragarde, teaching them to hunt “the most dangerous game.” He issues
challenges (e.g. “Shoot that deserter before he reaches his horse” or “Silence that Alliance lookout
without raising an alarm”). If the PC succeeds, Nathanos grants a nod of respect. Mechanically: after a
successful training night, the PC can claim a Boost (one-time +2) on a subsequent attack or stealth
roll in the campaign, reflecting Nathanos’s tutelage. If the PC fails or hesitates during training,
Nathanos scoffs and demonstrates the kill himself, shaming the PC (consider a compel on their pride
or confidence aspect). This trial-and-error training reinforces the PC’s improvement or their
resentment. 
Strategic Counsel: In war councils (Act II and III, e.g. before the Battle of Dazar’alor or Nazjatar),
Nathanos actually asks the PC’s opinion – not kindly, but in a “You’ve been useful, so tell me how
you’d infiltrate this city” way. This is a chance for the PC to influence tactics. If the PC’s plan is cruel
and effective (e.g. Careful approach: use blight in a pincer ambush), Nathanos will actually adopt it
and publicly credit “one of my operatives” (a rare acknowledgement). If the PC’s plan is too honorable
or cautious, Nathanos will override it and afterward privately warn the PC not to “grow soft.” These
interactions let the PC see a bit into Nathanos’s mind – how he values efficiency above all. It can also
plant seeds of rivalry: if the PC contradicts him too often, Nathanos might engineer a situation to
test them under pressure (or even fail to send reinforcements to “teach them a lesson” – a potential
compel in a battle scene). 
Cracks in the Armor (late Act III): In a somber moment after a costly Horde loss (say, after the
Alliance sack of Dazar’alor), Nathanos allows a glimpse of his true feelings. Perhaps one night the PC
finds Nathanos alone, brooding over a locket or keepsake from Lordaeron. If the PC presses2

carefully, he’ll snap at first – but a successful Careful or Empathy roll might get him talking in a low,
venomous tone about “what was taken from us”. He could allude to Sylvanas’s own pain or his,
without fully baring his soul. This is a pivotal bonding moment: If the PC expresses similar loss or
hatred, Nathanos and the PC find a grim kinship. The PC can then invoke “Bound by Love and Duty”
with his tacit permission in a future scene (e.g. to steel themselves against fear, knowing Nathanos
too fights for deeply personal reasons). However, if the PC shows pity or moralizing, Nathanos will
shut down entirely – likely snapping “Spare me your sermons!” and the relationship suffers. In
essence, the only “bond” Nathanos understands is shared bitterness and resolve. PCs who navigate
that tightrope gain a fiercely grudging ally; those who don’t will find him as distant as ever.
Romance Arc: None. Nathanos’s heart (what remains of it) belongs wholly to Sylvanas – in life and
undeath, she is the only one who ever mattered. He shows zero romantic interest in anyone else.
Any attempt by a PC to flirt or seduce would likely be met with scornful amusement or seen as a ploy. The
only conceivable exception is an unusually Sylvanas-like PC (e.g. an undead female with ruthless
demeanor) – and even then, it would be manipulation on his part, not genuine love. For all intents and
purposes, Nathanos is effectively “unromanceable” in a meaningful way. He might use attraction as a
weapon (the GM could have him feign mild flirtation to lure a gullible PC into Sylvanas’s schemes), but he
will never truly reciprocate feelings. If a PC does develop feelings for him, it likely ends in heartbreak or
betrayal – a tragic one-sided thread the GM can exploit for drama. In short, romance is off the table:
Nathanos’s love is Sylvanas, and his undeath has only crystallized that fact.
Rewards (Trust Outcomes): Successfully impressing Nathanos (short of full betrayal) yields dark rewards
befitting Sylvanas’s champion: 
Aspect – “Favored of the Dark Lady”: As noted, a fully trusted PC gains this aspect (with Sylvanas’s
imprimatur). It can be invoked for authority or fear within the Horde’s more sinister circles.
For example, the PC could invoke it to intimidate a Kor’kron guard to let them pass (“The Banshee
Queen’s chosen stands before you!”) or to rally Forsaken troops who recognize Sylvanas’s favor. It
also comes with narrative privileges: the PC might attend Sylvanas’s private war councils as
Nathanos’s plus-one, hearing information first-hand. 
Stunt – “Blightcaller’s Marksmanship” (optional): The PC trains under Nathanos’s eye to drastically
improve their ranged attacks. Once per session, the PC may declare they studied a foe’s weakness
like Nathanos would – the next hit they land ignores a Mild physical consequence or armor-based
aspect on the target (as Nathanos’s arrows punch through weak points). This effectively makes the
PC more lethal in line with his methods. 
Unique Item – Corrupted Farstrider Longbow: If the PC is a ranged fighter, Nathanos grants them
one of his reserve blackened longbows as a gift when they earn his trust. It carries the Aspect
“Forsaken Farsight.” The PC can invoke this for free once per game session to make an impossible
shot or see an enemy’s position from far away (like a brief sniper’s eye view). This symbolizes
Nathanos teaching them to “see as the Farstriders do, even in death.” 
Title – “ Champion of the Queen’s Will ” (Alternate path, if PC remained Sylvanas-loyal through Act III):
In the event the campaign allows Sylvanas-loyalists past the Battle of Orgrimmar, Sylvanas (before
departing) names the PC as a continuing agent of her will. Nathanos, in a private moment,
acknowledges this title grudgingly (perhaps a stiff nod, saying “Try not to embarrass her”). This title
doesn’t hold official weight in the new Horde (it might even be a secret mantle), but it marks the PC
for future plot hooks – e.g. Sylvanas may call on them during Shadowlands events, and Nathanos
would expect them to answer. It also gives the PC an inner strength – mechanically, once per
scenario they can invoke “Champion of the Queen’s Will” to automatically succeed at a daunting1011

willpower test (such as resisting torture or a fear effect), imagining Nathanos and Sylvanas watching
and refusing to yield under their judgment. 
Mount – “Blightcharger Warhorse” (optional for flavor): Nathanos allows the PC to stable one of
the Forsaken warhorses from his own regiment for their use. This undead steed, clad in jagged
armor, serves as a mount in narrative terms. It underscores the PC’s acceptance in the dark ranks. (In
Fate terms it’s mainly narrative color, but could justify very fast travel or a +1 to overcome rough
terrain on horseback when appropriate.)
Integrating Nathanos’s rewards should be done sparingly – they are powerful boons reflecting a morally
dark path. The GM should ensure that if the PC shifts away from Sylvanas post-war, some of these boons
might be lost (e.g. Alliance allies won’t heed “Favored of the Dark Lady” – it might even become a compelled
liability aspect in diplomacy). Conversely, if the PC stayed loyal and goes into exile or a new story as
Sylvanas’s agent, these rewards set them up as a formidable, albeit infamous, figure going forward.
High Exarch Turalyon (Alliance)
Psychological Profile: High Exarch Turalyon is a legendary paladin of the Silver Hand – a living icon of the
Light. Having fought the Burning Legion for a thousand years (thanks to time flowing differently in the
Nether) and returned to Azeroth as a hero of the Army of the Light, Turalyon embodies unwavering faith,
duty, and valor. He is devout to the Light to the point of zealotry; as one of the first paladins he was
taught that a paladin must be both a weapon and a beacon of hope. His motivation in BfA is to
protect the Alliance and Azeroth from any threat – be it Horde aggression or Old God corruption – with the
same fervor he once fought demons. He hopes for enduring peace through the Light’s grace, but fears the
Alliance might lack the unity or strength to prevail in the dark times ahead. Personality-wise, Turalyon is
noble, earnest, and guided by a strict moral compass. He can be warm and compassionate (especially to
soldiers and innocents) but after ages of war he also has a hardened, unforgiving side toward the wicked.
Notably, his wife Alleria Windrunner embraces the Void – a dichotomy that Turalyon struggles with silently.
He loves Alleria deeply and trusts her, yet the Void’s nature repulses his Light-driven instincts. This inner
conflict sometimes manifests as momentary sternness or concern when Alleria pushes the limits (such as
wielding void magic near the holy Sunwell, which nearly caused a crisis). In the Fourth War, Turalyon isn’t
front-and-center in every battle (having just rejoined Alliance leadership after Legion) but he is present at
key moments: the defense of Lordaeron, the Warfront in Arathi (where Alliance retakes Stromgarde), and
the Siege of Stormwind Vision (where he appears in N’Zoth’s vision as a tragic figure). He speaks with a
calm authority, often invoking the Light and the memory of fallen heroes (he reveres comrades like Anduin
Lothar). Turalyon’s biggest flaw is his potential for fanaticism – his absolute belief in the Light could lead to
harsh decisions (as glimpsed post-BFA when he ruthlessly hunts Sylvanas’s loyalists ). But during BfA,
under Anduin’s command, he keeps those tendencies in check, acting as a mentor and paragon for the
Alliance. PCs will find him an inspiring leader, but one who demands unwavering honor and may not tolerate
moral compromise.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept – “High Exarch of the Lightforged” (ancient paladin hero infused with Light). Trouble
– “Zealous Crusader’s Burden” (absolute faith can blind him to nuance – he struggles with the Void, dark
tactics, or mercy to irredeemable foes). Other Aspects – “Blessed Blade of the Silver Hand” (wields the holy
blade Light’s Vanguard, symbolic of old and new Alliance) and “Heart of a Lion, Will of the Light” (courageous
leader who never gives up hope). These capture his millennia of experience, devout righteousness, and• 
12
1314

16
1718
5

inner conflict between compassion and righteous wrath.
- Approaches: Forceful +4, Careful +3, Flashy +2, Clever +1, Quick +1, Sneaky +0. (Turalyon is foremost a
forceful presence – in battle he strikes like a hammer of Light and in command he is resolute. He plans
carefully, honed by long military leadership. He can be Flashy when channeling the Light’s brilliance or
rallying troops with stirring words. He’s less inclined to subtlety or trickery; honesty and directness are his
way.)
- Stunts: Exarch’s Light – Once per session, Turalyon may Forcefully overcome an obstacle or purge a
supernatural effect by calling a grand miracle of Light. For example, he could cleanse a plague blight from a
city square or push back an Old God void storm with a holy nova. This automatically succeeds at
overcoming any darkness/undeath-based obstacle up to a major scale (he spends a Fate point). Divine
Shield – Turalyon can Carefully create an advantage “ Blessing of the Silver Hand ” on himself or an ally,
once per scene. This holy shield (visualized as golden light) grants +2 on the target’s next defense roll or can
absorb a mild consequence entirely (the shield shatters afterward). Army of the Light Veteran – Due to
ages of warfare, Turalyon gets +2 to Cleverly create an advantage when strategizing against demonic,
undead, or void forces (he’s seen almost every trick of the darkness and knows how to counter it).
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 4, Mental 4. Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6). (Turalyon is
extraordinarily resilient – the Light literally bolsters his body and soul after centuries of battle. He also has
an additional Mild consequence slot dedicated to “Light exhaustion” – reflecting that if he pushes miracles
too far, he tires spiritually, but this can recover faster with prayer.)
Trust-Building Questline: Earning Turalyon’s trust is akin to gaining the favor of a legendary paladin – it
requires demonstrations of pure valor, faith, and loyalty to the Alliance’s highest ideals. He may be initially
cordial to all Alliance champions, but true trust means he’ll consider a PC a worthy comrade-in-arms of the
Light. This questline unfolds primarily for Alliance PCs (Horde PCs will only see Turalyon as an adversary on
the battlefield, though conceivably a Horde PC could impress him through honorable conduct in a truce or
via a neutral quest against a greater evil). Key milestones:
Defender of Lordaeron (Act I – Battle for Lordaeron): Turalyon joins the Alliance assault on the
Undercity. During the chaotic retreat through the blighted ruins, a moment arises where civilians or
wounded soldiers are trapped behind blight or under fire. The PC can distinguish themselves by 
braving great peril to save others: for instance, rushing back into blight gas to pull a fallen
comrade out, or holding a chokepoint against Horde forces long enough for priests to cleanse
survivors. Turalyon notices this selflessness. He personally aids the PC, perhaps by casting a flash of
Light to part the blight and shouting “With me, champion!” If the PC succeeds in the rescue, Turalyon
clasps their shoulder afterward, saying something like, “The Light shines through your actions. Well
done.” (Mark a significant step on the trust clock.) If the PC instead pursued vengeance over
protection (e.g. chasing Nathanos instead of helping the wounded), Turalyon will be polite but clearly
disappointed (trust gains minimal). 
A Oath of Blood and Light (Act II – Interlude, Alliance War Council): In the early war campaign,
Alleria and Turalyon hold council with Anduin and other leaders. The PC is present (perhaps as a
trusted agent of Anduin). During a strategy discussion, a sensitive issue arises: using Void powers in
war. Alleria offers void tactics to track Sylvanas’s movements; Turalyon visibly tenses. The PC can earn
trust here by mediating between them with wisdom and loyalty. For example, the PC might
volunteer for a mission that uses both Lightforged and Void elves in tandem – showing open-
mindedness and faith that unity is strength. Success: The PC’s plan leads to a productive mission
(perhaps hunting a Horde spy using Alleria’s void senses guided by Turalyon’s Lightforged soldiers).
Turalyon, initially wary, sees the PC’s ability to harmonize opposing forces. He confides in the PC1.

afterward, admitting, “Old soldiers can learn new ways… You’ve given me hope that Light and
Shadow can serve together.” This candid admission greatly boosts trust – Turalyon now views the PC
as someone who can temper zeal with reason. Failure: If the PC mishandles the situation (e.g.
choosing sides or showing prejudice), the tension remains and Turalyon’s trust doesn’t deepen. (The
GM might portray Turalyon privately advising Anduin that the PC may lack spiritual fortitude or unity,
delaying future trust rewards until the PC proves otherwise in another way.) 
Light’s Judgment (Act III – Siege of Stromgarde Warfront): Turalyon leads Alliance forces in
retaking Stromgarde in Arathi Highlands. The PC is at his side during a critical moment – say,
the Horde champions launch a counteroffensive with stolen Azerite war machines and dark rangers.
Turalyon, mounted on his war-steed, charges into battle with the PC. Here the PC can demonstrate
unwavering courage and strategic insight. One scenario: a Lightforged draenei, Captain Fareeya, is
struck down by a Horde champion amidst the melee. Turalyon moves to save her but is engaged by
two hulking warriors. If the PC immediately leaps to protect Fareeya, fighting off the attacker
and then using a healing salve or a basic Light spell (if they have that skill) to stabilize her, this
deeply impresses Turalyon. He sees the PC living the creed of the Silver Hand: “By act of compassion,
you save a comrade.” After the battle is won, Turalyon formally thanks the PC in front of the Alliance
troops, saying their name and declaring them a “hero of the Alliance” for all to hear. This public
commendation cements high trust. (If using Fate mechanics, the PC might gain a boost or temporary
aspect “Celebrated by Alliance Forces” as an immediate perk.) Alternate path: If the PC instead
decided to chase personal glory (like dueling the Horde commander while others were in peril), the
Alliance might still win, but Turalyon’s praise will be lukewarm – he might privately remind the PC
that duty to others comes before duels of honor. The trust clock in that case increases only slightly,
with perhaps another opportunity needed for full trust. 
When Trust is filled, Turalyon accepts the PC as a true brother/sister-in-arms. He will speak of them in the
same breath as the honored heroes of the Alliance. Reward: The PC is formally inducted (or reaffirmed) as a
Champion of the Silver Hand under Turalyon’s leadership. This grants the Aspect “Blessed by the High
Exarch” – the PC may invoke this for +2 whenever calling upon the Light’s favor or rallying Alliance faithful
in dire circumstances. Narratively, there could be a ceremony in the Cathedral of Light: Turalyon, with
Anduin and priests present, lays his hand on the PC’s shoulder and a warm golden light shines, marking the
PC as an exemplar of the Light. (Even if the PC isn’t a paladin or priest, this signifies they carry the Light
symbolically – their cause is just.) Additionally, Turalyon entrusts the PC with a sacred artifact from the Army
of the Light: perhaps a shard of the Vindicaar’s core or a redeemed Naaru crystal. Game Mechanics: The
PC gains a Stunt: “Light’s Boon of the Exarch” – once per session, they can automatically succeed at
overcoming a fear effect, mind control, or shadow corruption OR grant an ally an immediate recovery of a
Mild mental consequence, by invoking the Light’s Boon (the crystal glows with Turalyon’s blessing to
strengthen their resolve). This stunt emphasizes the tangible benefit of Turalyon’s trust: the PC literally
carries a piece of his Light. 
Finally, Turalyon invites the PC to fight by his side in the climactic battles to come (e.g. at the Gates of
Orgrimmar in Act V and in any confrontation with N’Zoth’s minions). Fighting alongside Turalyon grants the
PC a reliable ally aspect in those scenes (“Fighting Beside the High Exarch”) which the GM can allow as a free
invoke for dramatic teamwork moments (for instance, the PC and Turalyon performing a combined attack,
such as Turalyon’s Light enhancing the PC’s strike). The PC has essentially gained a powerful friend and
mentor at war’s end.
Light-Forged Ascension Questline: Special – Unlockable through Trust or Heroic Deeds. Turalyon carries
within him the memories of Xe’ra’s Lightforging rituals. If the PC is particularly valorous (either by maxing3. 
1920
7

Turalyon’s trust or by some alternate truly heroic feat, like voluntarily sacrificing themselves in battle and
being saved, or purifying a major evil), he offers them a chance to undergo a “Light-Forged Ascension.”
This is an extremely rare honor – essentially attempting to infuse the PC with the Light’s essence as was
done to create the Lightforged Draenei. 
Prerequisite: The PC must either have earned Turalyon’s complete trust or have performed an act of
“sublime heroism” that Turalyon witnessed (GM’s discretion, but examples might be: saving an entire
village from a Blight by holding off Horde forces single-handedly, or jumping in front of Turalyon to
take a killing blow meant for him, surviving only barely). Turalyon will judge that the PC’s spirit is
strong enough to endure the trial by Light. 
Quest Steps: This would likely occur as a side-quest during Act IV (after the Alliance defeat at
Dazar’alor, when morale is low and they seek new strengths) or Act V (when gearing up for the final
confrontation with Sylvanas or N’Zoth). Turalyon leads the PC and perhaps a small retinue (Yrel’s
pupil Fareeya, a priest, maybe Alleria observing warily) to a holy site – possibly the X’era’s remnants
kept in the Vault of Lights or a sacred Naaru enclave aboard the Vindicaar. The quest involves tests of
Light and Dark:
Trial of Valor: The PC must spar with an image of their own doubts conjured by the Light. Turalyon
stands as witness. The PC rolls to overcome an internal conflict; if they have any aspect related to
guilt or fear, it will be compelled visually by the Light in this trial. They must demonstrate
unshakeable resolve (likely a Will roll or similar overcome). 
Trial of Sacrifice: The PC is bathed in searing holy light that reveals all their flaws. It’s excruciating –
they endure a mental attack representing pain/purification (the PC might take mental stress or even
a consequence like “Scoured by Holy Fire” during the process). They must willingly “let go” of
something – perhaps they vow to uphold a particular Virtue or relinquish a personal vendetta –
something to prove they won’t misuse the Light’s gift. Turalyon might gently prompt: “What would
you sacrifice to become a beacon in the darkness?” The PC’s answer and actions here determine
success. 
Ascension: If the PC passes the trials, Turalyon channels the Light with others to infuse the PC. In
game terms, this could be a montage culminating in the PC gaining a new Aspect “Lightforged
Heart” (or replacing an aspect with it). This denotes they have been fundamentally touched by the
Light. Visually, the PC may gain a golden glint in their eyes or a permanent faint rune on their skin. 
Outcome – Success: The PC emerges from the ritual reborn (not as a new race per se, but spiritually
elevated). Mechanical Benefit: The PC can once per session call upon Lightforged Heart to perform a
miraculous act without spending a fate point (essentially one free invoke/session on that aspect that
can even do things normally not allowed, within reason of holy magic). For example, they could auto-
succeed at banishing a minor demon, or purify a poisoned well instantly, or survive an attack that
should have killed them by the Light’s grace. Additionally, their body is tougher – the GM might grant
+1 physical stress box or the ability to treat one physical consequence per scenario as one level lower
if it’s from fire/shadow (since their body resists those). Turalyon congratulates them, possibly
kneeling briefly (an incredible gesture) and saying, “Arise, $PCName$, Lightforged Champion of the
Alliance.” It’s a stirring moment of personal triumph. 
Outcome – Failure or Refusal: Not everyone is ready for ascension. If the PC fails a trial (say they
cannot overcome their inner darkness, or balk at the pain), the ritual halts. Turalyon, though
disappointed, is kind. “It appears the Light has other paths for you,” he’d say. There is no shame; the
PC keeps Turalyon’s respect but does not gain the ascension powers. Alternatively, the PC might • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•

choose to refuse the ritual, perhaps out of fear it could change them or out of loyalty to another
power (a druid PC might say “My path is with Nature, not the Light”). Turalyon understands, though
he may try once to persuade (“In these times, we need every weapon against the darkness…”). If they
still refuse, he respects their choice. The trust remains, though the unique reward is forfeit. 
This Light-Forged Ascension questline can serve as a capstone for Turalyon’s mentorship. It should be
presented as entirely optional – a PC may decline it for roleplay reasons, which could lead to interesting
story beats (perhaps Alleria privately approving of the PC’s refusal, finding common ground in walking a
different path than Turalyon’s pure Light). If the PC accepts and succeeds, they effectively become a living
conduit of the Light, second only to Turalyon and a few others, which could have implications in any future
storyline (e.g. in Shadowlands or if the Lightbound from alternate Draenor become relevant).
Bonding Arc (Mentorship & Guidance): Once the PC has proven themselves, Turalyon offers not just
alliance but personal mentorship. Despite Turalyon’s immense age and status, he remains humble in
teaching. This arc emphasizes leadership, spirituality, and bridging Light and Shadow. Some scenes to
illustrate their growing bond:
Lessons of the Silver Hand: Turalyon invites the PC to Stormwind’s Cathedral or an Army of the
Light encampment for training. He shares anecdotes of learning under Archbishop Faol and fighting
alongside Anduin Lothar. In one session, he might mentor the PC in sword technique and
prayer simultaneously. Example: He has the PC recite the Virtues of the Light (Respect, Tenacity,
Compassion) while sparring with practice swords in the cathedral courtyard at dawn. Mechanically:
After training, the PC gains a temporary aspect “Trained by Turalyon” for the next conflict, which they
can invoke once when fighting honorably or protecting others. This reflects Turalyon’s teaching
sinking in. If the PC is already a paladin/cleric, this is a profound deepening of their practice (perhaps
unlocking a new stunt or extra mild consequence slot for holy damage). If the PC is not a holy
warrior, Turalyon’s mentorship still improves their leadership and discipline – e.g. a rogue might
learn from him the value of patience and gain +1 to a subsequent Overcome roll that requires
steadfastness. 
Heart-to-Heart – The Burden of War: During a lull (perhaps on a voyage to Kul Tiras or a camp after
a victory), Turalyon and the PC share a quiet conversation. Turalyon confides some of his personal
struggles – for instance, how it felt to return after a thousand years to find so much changed, or his
guilt that he wasn’t on Azeroth to stop earlier tragedies (like Theramore or the Broken Shore). He
may also speak of Alleria, expressing that “After so long in the Light, I sometimes worry I can’t fully
understand the shadows my wife walks in.” This is a chance for the PC to empathize and even advise 
him (a reversal of roles showing deep trust). If the PC gives thoughtful counsel or shares their own
vulnerabilities, Turalyon’s esteem for them grows. He might smile and say, “You have wisdom beyond
your years” or even, half-jokingly, “perhaps the Light sent you to guide me as well.” From this point,
he considers the PC a personal friend. In game terms, the PC can thereafter attempt to influence
Turalyon’s decisions with social rolls at a bonus (the GM might allow a +2 or reduced difficulty when
the PC tries to persuade him of a plan, reflecting that he genuinely values their perspective). If the
PC ever needs a favor (like military support for a personal mission), Turalyon is far more inclined to
grant it if it aligns with Alliance goals. 
The Lion and the Void (Act IV – Nazjatar or Pre-N’Zoth): A powerful scene can occur if the PC
somehow balances Light and Shadow in their party (for example, if the PC group includes a warlock,
shadow priest or they themselves use edgy powers). Turalyon might accompany the PC on a mission
to retrieve an Azerite artifact from a Nazjatar ruin. During an ambush, a void aberration (spawn of
N’Zoth) attacks and ensnares Turalyon, whispering maddening visions. If the PC or one of their allies• 
2113
• 
• 
9

uses a forbidden power (say, a shadow spell or even fel magic) to save Turalyon, he must confront his
bias. Initially after being freed, he’s alarmed – perhaps a brief conflict of words where he cites the
danger of such powers. The PC, in this bonding moment, can challenge him kindly: “High Exarch, you
taught me that the Light must protect life at all costs – sometimes that means accepting help from
the shadows.” This is a heavy roleplay moment. If handled diplomatically (and possibly a Careful
or Empathy roll succeeds), Turalyon lets out a thoughtful breath and nods. “Perhaps the Light tests
me to see beyond old prejudices,” he admits. This breakthrough solidifies that the PC has tempered
Turalyon’s zeal with their influence. From now on, Turalyon will be more flexible (the GM can reflect
this by not having him oppose shadow-using allies in the party, and even defending them to any
Alliance skeptics). The bond between PC and Turalyon becomes one of mutual growth – each making
the other stronger and wiser. If instead the PC responds abrasively (e.g. “We saved you, don’t be
ungrateful!”) or fails the persuasion, Turalyon might remain stiff: trust plateauing. He won’t turn on
the PC, but a bit of distance remains until perhaps a later resolution. 
Overall, the mentorship with Turalyon should leave the PC feeling uplifted and guided. By the campaign’s
end, Turalyon may even consider them a prospective future leader (“When this war is over, the Alliance will
need torchbearers like you”). In an epilogue, he could pen a letter of recommendation to Anduin for the PC
or even pledge to nominate them for command of a Alliance unit or a holy order. The PC essentially gains a
lifelong ally and mentor in Turalyon, with all the responsibilities and expectations that entails.
Romance Arc: None (or strictly platonic). Turalyon’s heart lies firmly with Alleria Windrunner, his wife of
many decades (by his perspective, eons). Their love endured separation across centuries and the
reunion in Legion. It is a cornerstone of his character – he fights for the future of Azeroth with Alleria by his
side. As such, Turalyon is not romantically available. He is polite and somewhat fatherly to younger heroes,
and respectful to women and men alike, but never flirtatious. If a PC tried to initiate romantic overtures,
Turalyon would likely gently and honorably deflect: e.g. he might smile kindly and say, “You give an old
soldier undeserved attention. I am honored by your camaraderie.” If persistent, he would more firmly but
courteously state that his vows and heart are taken. The only potential emotional arc outside of romance
could be a deep mentor-protégé bond where the PC feels great admiration (even infatuation) that isn’t
reciprocated in kind. The GM can play on this if a PC develops a “crush”: Alleria’s presence (or even jealousy,
if she senses something) might create a subplot. But ultimately, Turalyon remains devoted to Alleria. He
wears on his finger a simple golden ring from ages past; in moments of respite he is known to pray for her
and Arator. PCs will not come between that. In summary, any “romance” inclination from the PC should be
guided toward a respectful friendship. Turalyon’s story in BfA is about balancing the Light and personal
loyalty – his marriage being the key example of that balance (Light and Void united in harmony). The
campaign should preserve that lore-consistent relationship. 
Rewards (Gear/Stunts/Titles): Walking in the Light under Turalyon’s guidance yields some of the most
radiant rewards of the Alliance:
Title – “Knight-Champion of the Silver Hand”: Turalyon, with Anduin’s assent, bestows this title
upon the trusted PC during a ceremony at Stormwind or the Cathedral of Light. In Fate terms, this
doesn’t grant numerical bonuses by itself, but it has immense narrative weight. The PC is recognized
across Alliance territories as a champion. Priests and paladins of every race show them respect,
common folk in Alliance cities know their name. The GM should reflect this with easier social rolls
among Alliance citizens and perhaps minor favors (a village priest might heal them without cost, a
militia might follow their lead in a crisis, etc.). Essentially, the PC’s reputation in the Alliance is sky-
high – akin to becoming a Sir/Lady of the realm. 2212

10

Aspect – “Blessed by the High Exarch”: As described, this aspect is acquired at high trust.
Mechanically invokable for divine aid or influence where Turalyon’s backing matters. For instance,
the PC could invoke it when attempting to convince a Lightforged draenei platoon to undertake a
risky maneuver (“Turalyon trusts my judgment, and so should you”) or to withstand a moment of
despair by recalling Turalyon’s words of faith. The GM can also compel it: being blessed by Turalyon
might mean the PC is called to higher moral standards (they might be compelled to not use a
dishonorable tactic because “what would High Exarch say?”). Overall it’s a powerful story tool. 
Light’s Vanguard Vestments (Unique Gear): Turalyon gifts the PC a piece of equipment from the
Army of the Light armory as a sign of trust. Choose based on the PC’s class: e.g. a tabard or cloak
bearing the golden crest of the Silver Hand, woven with threads of Light. It has the Aspect “Light’s
Vanguard” which the PC can invoke once per session for free to either defend against a shadow/
void attack or create an advantage related to inspiring allies. Example use: The PC drapes their
Light-forged cloak to ward off a wave of void energy (invoke to nullify or reduce a magical attack), or
they hold it aloft on a battlement rallying troops (invoke to create “Banner of the Silver Hand –
Morale Boosted” on the battlefield). Visually, this item might glow softly in darkness, symbolizing
hope. 
Exarch’s Warhorse (Mount): If appropriate for the campaign, Turalyon arranges for the PC to
receive a steed from the stable of the Army of the Light. This might be a majestic golden-armored
charger or even one of those Lightforged elekk if the PC is draenei-inclined. In narrative, this mount
allows the PC swift travel and a dramatic entrance in battles. (Mechanically, could grant +2 to Quick
overcome rolls involving long-distance travel or chases on horseback, once per session, due to the
mount’s exceptional stamina and speed.) At the end of the war, Turalyon personally hands the reins
to the PC, saying, “May this steed bear you on many righteous quests to come.” 
Stunt – “Light in the Darkness”: Through Turalyon’s teachings, the PC develops a stunt that reflects
their internalization of his principles. For example: Once per scenario, when an ally has fallen to 0 stress
or is taken out, the PC can touch them and roll Will (or Forceful) vs a target of 3. If successful, the ally is
restored to fight on with 1 stress box recovered or a mild consequence healed, as the PC’s sheer
determination and Light’s blessing refuse to let them fall. Essentially, it’s a limited battle resurrection or
second wind they can grant – very much in line with a paladin rushing to a fallen friend and shouting
“Stand in the Light!” This stunt can be seen as the PC’s own heroic style but clearly inspired by
Turalyon’s influence (perhaps he did something similar during the war, which the PC witnessed and
learned from).
All these rewards should be balanced by narrative consequences. Being an acclaimed Lightforged champion
might draw unwanted attention from the Horde’s dark entities (a servant of Sylvanas or even a cunning
dreadlord might mark the PC as a threat to eliminate, which can be used as a plot hook later). Also, if the PC
ever wavers in their virtue (say they commit a questionable act), their new Aspect or title could be
compelled to cause crises of faith or public outcry (“Champion of the Silver Hand? Hah! And yet you burn
villages?” – NPCs might call them out). Turalyon himself might reappear in a later story to either support the
PC further or, if things went poorly, to sternly remind them of the path of righteousness.
Integrating Turalyon’s mentorship and rewards into the campaign’s Acts ensures a payoff not just in stats
but in the PC’s personal development. By Act V, as the Alliance and rebel Horde stand at the gates of
Orgrimmar, the PC could be the one to step forward beside Turalyon, bearing the holy standard, their
presence giving pause even to Sylvanas’s forces. And if the campaign extends to dealing with N’Zoth (patch
8.3 events), a PC who underwent the Light-Forged Ascension might shine in the final battle against
darkness – literally countering the Old God’s void with the Light within them. Turalyon’s final advice to the• 
• 
• 
• 
11

PC as the curtain closes on BFA might be: “The war is over, but the duty remains. Go forth, $PCName$, and
let the Light guide your every step.” In that, the PC has truly become a part of Azeroth’s living legacy.
Arator the Redeemer (Alliance)
Psychological Profile: Arator the Redeemer is the young half-elven son of Alleria Windrunner and Turalyon
– a living symbol of the union between Alliance’s Light and the quel’dorei legacy. Having grown up
hearing of his parents’ heroism (and spending years searching for them across Outland), Arator is earnest,
idealistic, and eager to prove himself. His motivation is deeply personal: to honor the legacy of his father
and mother, and to protect the world his parents nearly gave everything for. Arator hopes to unite his dual
heritage – the discipline and faith of his human/paladin side and the agility and intuition of his elven/
ranger side – to become a new kind of champion. He fears failing to live up to the legends of Turalyon and
Alleria. In social situations, Arator is polite, somewhat reverent to veterans (he addresses older heroes as
“sir/madam” often), but there’s a quiet confidence growing in him. He’s in that transitional phase from
squire to knight. The Army of the Light campaign in Legion hardened him somewhat, but compared to war-
scarred elders, Arator still has a youthful optimism. He is devoted to the Light like his father, but also open-
minded toward the Void due to his mother – though the void unsettles him, he doesn’t condemn it out of
hand (he loves his mother after all). This gives him a thoughtful perspective: he might quietly mediate
between zealous Lightforged and renounced Void elves, urging understanding. In BfA, Arator is not a major
NPC on the battlefield, but he can be logically placed at the Alliance Embassy in Stormwind (where Alleria
and Turalyon station between missions) and on the Vindicaar spaceship above Azeroth, aiding in
coordination. Perhaps he aids in the Stromgarde Warfront as a junior paladin or serves under Turalyon’s
command off screen. The GM can easily insert Arator as a companion for Alliance PCs during interludes or
special missions (e.g. a quest in Outland or against remnants of the Legion, where he’d be keen to help).
Personality-wise, he is kind, a bit shy in the shadow of great leaders, but fiercely courageous when faced with
evil. Think of him as a youthful paladin who says a prayer before battle and then fights with surprising
ferocity. He’s also notably family-oriented – he speaks of his parents with pride, and of his Windrunner
aunts (yes, Sylvanas and Vereesa are his aunts) with a mix of wonder and sorrow. The atrocities of Sylvanas
weigh on him as a personal tragedy, yet he still believes in the goodness of the Windrunner line (Vereesa
gives him hope). This complex family tie can emerge in roleplay: he might ask the PC (if they’re savvy) what
they think drives Sylvanas, or how to redeem those lost to darkness. Ultimately, Arator is on a journey of
growth in BfA. PCs befriending him will witness a bright young hero coming into his own – or potentially
see him struggle with the duality of Light and Void.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept – “Half-Elven Squire of the Light” (youthful paladin-in-training, carrying two legacies).
Trouble – “Legacy to Live Up To” (pressure of famous parents can make him overextend or doubt himself).
Other – “Blood of the Alliance” (his mixed heritage symbolizes human and high elf unity, giving him
perspective and support from both), “Heart of the Redeemer” (compassionate and forgiving, he seeks to save
or redeem those he can – even some enemies). These aspects reflect his unique background, internal drive,
and gentle nature in war.
- Approaches: Quick +3, Careful +2, Forceful +2, Clever +1, Flashy +1, Sneaky +0. (Arator moves with the
speed and grace of his elven lineage in battle, and he has learned discipline so he plans carefully as a junior
officer. He can swing a warhammer or bow with decent Force, though he’s not brute-strong like full orcs.
He’s not particularly deceptive or showy – he tends to fight and act in a straightforward, genuine way.)
- Stunts: Holy Strike: Once per scene, Arator can channel the Light like his father taught him. He makes a23
12

Forceful attack with a melee strike that glows with holy energy, gaining +2 on that attack against undead or
void creatures specifically (as the Light sears such foes). Swift Ranger’s Shot: If fighting at range, Arator
can Quickly attack with his crossbow, and once per scene he may reroll a missed ranged attack by invoking
his half-elven Farstrider instincts (he grew up learning marksmanship from stories of his uncles/aunts).
Essentially, if he misses, he can say “No, steady…” and loose another bolt accurately. Inspiring Beacon:
Having seen the Army of the Light’s unity, Arator can Carefully create an advantage once per session
representing rallying those around him. For example, “Young Hope” or “Rally under the Redeemer” can be
placed on the scene (a free invoke for allies). Narratively, this might be him raising his sword and shouting
“For the Alliance, for the Light!” with an earnest passion that heartens nearby soldiers.
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 3, Mental 3 (he’s hardy but not yet at veteran levels). Consequence slots:
Mild (2), Moderate (4). (Arator can take some hits, but a severe trial could break him – he’s not as seasoned
as older heroes, so no severe slot by default. The GM could give him a severe if dramatically appropriate but
likely he’d be taken out by that point.)
Trust-Building Questline: Befriending Arator is a gentler endeavor than with hardened commanders – it’s
about proving camaraderie, sharing ideals, and maybe offering guidance to him as well. The PC who
treats Arator not just as “Turalyon’s kid” but as a valued ally will earn his genuine friendship and loyalty. This
questline can occur during off-duty moments between major acts or small side missions. It’s naturally
Alliance-side (Horde PCs would rarely interact with Arator except possibly as an enemy they might spare or
something – though a cross-faction friendship could theoretically occur if the campaign had neutral
meetups, but we focus on Alliance context). Key milestones:
The Young Hero’s Welcome (Act I, post-Lordaeron): After the Battle of Lordaeron, back in
Stormwind, the PC finds Arator at the Stormwind Harbor or Embassy. This is likely their first meeting.
Arator is helping triage wounded or organizing supplies for the next campaign. A scene plays out:
one of the wounded, a veteran soldier, mutters that Arator hasn’t truly seen war yet – perhaps
questioning his competence. The PC can step in to defend or encourage Arator. For example, the PC
might say to the grumbling veteran: “I saw this young man on the field – he held the line as
staunchly as any of us” (even if the PC didn’t literally see it, they endorse him). Or directly to Arator:
“Pay no heed. You did well and will do greater still – I can tell.” Arator is clearly grateful and relieved
by the PC’s support. He opens up slightly, thanking the PC and maybe admitting, “I worry I’ll never be
as strong as Father, or as fearless as Mother.” This vulnerability is an opening for trust. If the PC
offers earnest reassurance or a relatable anecdote of overcoming self-doubt, Arator’s eyes light
up and he regards the PC as someone safe to talk to. Mark first trust progress. (If instead the PC
brushed him off or agreed with the harsh assessment, Arator would be crestfallen and more shy
around them, delaying friendship.) 
Sharpening Skills (Act II, during Kul Tiras campaign downtime): Arator approaches the PC at
Alliance camp (perhaps in Boralus or aboard the Wind’s Redemption ship) asking if he might train with
them. He knows the PC is an accomplished fighter and humbly requests sparring practice or tips.
This is a chance for the PC to mentor Arator a bit (even if the PC is only a little older or same age,
they likely have more on-field experience than him). Training Montage: The PC and Arator duel with
practice weapons on the deck of a ship at sunset, or do target practice with bows on the cliffs of Kul
Tiras. The GM can have Arator struggle at first – maybe he’s used to fighting demons, not humans,
so the PC can exploit a flaw in his stance. The PC can then Carefully or Cleverly explain how to adjust.
Arator’s performance improves (perhaps the PC makes a Combat or appropriate roll to create an
advantage “Finding Arator’s Rhythm” that helps him). This mechanical bit could translate to Arator
doing better in the next actual fight (the GM might give him +1 in a battle scene thanks to the PC’s1. 
2. 
13

training). Outcome: If the PC is patient and encouraging, Arator’s confidence grows. After sparring,
he’s sweating and smiling: “I’ve learned more in one evening with you than weeks drilling alone.” He
clearly now admires the PC. Trust increases. As a symbol, Arator might share something personal –
e.g. he shows the PC a family keepsake (maybe a locket with sketches of Alleria and Turalyon, or a
rune stone from his aunt Vereesa). He entrusts the PC to hold it for a moment, explaining its
significance. This is a big deal: Arator doesn’t open up to everyone. The PC earns a free invoke on an
aspect like “Arator’s Respect” for future social influence. (If the training went poorly – say the PC
belittled him or was too harsh – Arator could become discouraged. Perhaps he fails noticeably in the
next skirmish, which could lead to a moment where the PC must either apologize/encourage him to
fix the damage or risk him withdrawing. Ideally, keep it positive to move forward.) 
Trials of Two Legacies (Act III, mid-war scenario): A special side mission arises that hits close to
Arator’s background. For instance, during the war campaign the Alliance intercepts a Horde attempt
to steal an artifact from Allerian Stronghold in Outland (a logical side-quest since Alleria’s old base
might hold naaru shards or such). The PC and Arator (and maybe a few NPC soldiers) go through the
Dark Portal to Outland to stop this. In the process, they encounter something personal: perhaps a 
fallen comrade of Turalyon from years ago turned into an undead, or a void apparition connected
to Alleria’s past. Arator faces a moment of crisis – e.g. the undead foe taunts him: “Your father left
me to die in these wastes, boy… and now I’ll have my vengeance.” Arator is rattled, his faith in his
father’s legend shaken. Meanwhile, a void rift opens (maybe triggered by the artifact) whispering
insidiously to Arator about how he might never live up to either parent. The PC must help Arator
overcome this trial: It could be done with either a stirring speech (Provoke/Empathy to snap him
out of doubt) or by example (the PC fights off the undead while demonstrating forgiveness or
reason, showing Arator the right path). If the PC calls upon what they know – reminding Arator of the
true values his parents stand for (“Your father is a hero not because he’s flawless, but because he
never gives up on the Light” or “Alleria conquered the whispers – you have her strength in you!”) –
Arator gathers himself. He might physically join the PC to close the void rift, each using Light and
shadow in tandem (a symbolic unity: maybe Arator casts a Holy spell while the PC or someone uses a
shadow spell, sealing the rift). After victory, Arator kneels by the remains of the undead foe and says
a prayer, showing mercy. Trust maxes out here as Arator truly grows, thanks to the PC. He
expresses profound gratitude: “Without you, I might have faltered. I see now that I must forge my
own path – guided by the Light and those I trust… like you.” From now on, Arator is unreservedly
loyal to the PC. (If the PC failed to support him – say they were too busy or dismissive – Arator could
fall into despair or act rashly, possibly suffering a serious wound or making a mistake. The PC would
then have to save him physically and emotionally to salvage trust, maybe in a later scene. It’s
dramatic but ideally the PC succeeds here for the best outcome.)
When Trust is complete, Arator’s relationship with the PC becomes one of true friendship (or possibly
more, if romance sparks – see below). He looks up to the PC akin to an older sibling or mentor figure even if
the PC is of similar age; it’s about experience and character. He will defend the PC against any naysayers,
and eagerly go where they go (if appropriate to the story). Reward: The PC gains the Aspect “Brother-in-
Arms of Arator”. This symbolizes not only Arator’s personal loyalty, but also a foot in the door with the
illustrious Windrunner-Fordragon family. It can be invoked for +2 in scenarios like: convincing Alliance
leaders of something (Turalyon and Alleria’s son vouching for the PC carries weight), dealing with high elves
or void elves (as Arator’s half-elf status bridges those worlds, his friend gets some trust too), or resisting
fear (facing horrors with the knowledge that this steadfast young paladin has their back). The GM might
also allow invoking it when performing cooperative actions with Arator – e.g. a combined attack or a
coordinated tactic – since their synergy is strong. Narratively, Arator might gift the PC a symbol of this bond:
perhaps he presents them with a medallion depicting the Silver Hand on one side and the Windrunner3. 
14

crest on the other. “So you’ll never forget that you have family in me,” he says. This medallion itself could
serve as a minor talisman (maybe once per session it allows the PC to reroll a failed defense against fear or
enchantment, as the thought of their friendship fortifies their will).
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: It’s hard to imagine a PC actively betraying Arator unless the PC changes
allegiance dramatically. But possible alternate paths: If the PC is Alliance but commits a grave dishonor
(say they murder prisoners or do something that horrifies Alliance ideals), Arator will struggle. He might
confront the PC privately, hurt and confused. Depending on PC’s response, Arator could either be convinced
to stick by them (perhaps believing in redemption) or, if the act was truly heinous and the PC unrepentant,
Arator will distance himself. He might report the deed to Turalyon or at least refuse further companionship
(“This is not what we fought for … I cannot follow you down this path.”). This would effectively sever the trust
– a tragic turn where Arator sadly departs from the PC’s story or even opposes them later if they fully turned
villain. The GM should telegraph Arator’s disappointment well in advance with compels on “Heart of the
Redeemer” etc., giving the PC chances to atone. 
Another alternate branch: Cross-faction respect. If a Horde PC in some scenario spared Arator’s life or
showed him great honor (imagine a duel where the PC, seeing Arator outmatched, chose to yield rather
than kill him, or even fought alongside him under a temporary truce against say a demon), Arator would
remember. In a subsequent parley (maybe Act V’s armistice negotiations), Arator could approach that Horde
PC and acknowledge their honor. While not “friends”, there could be a connection: the Horde PC gains an
aspect “Respected by Arator” temporarily, which might help smooth talks between Alliance/Horde at war’s
end. This is an aside from the main trust arc but shows how his innate fairness can extend even to an
enemy if they earned it.
Bonding Arc (Mentorship & Fellowship): Because Arator is young, the bonding can be as much the PC
mentoring him as vice versa. It’s a friendship arc with elements of the PC helping shape Arator into a hero,
and Arator offering the PC a fresh, hopeful perspective that older war-weary NPCs lack. Scenes to include:
Lighter Moments: Amidst all the war, show Arator’s youth in small off-duty scenes. For example, in
Boralus, Arator admits he’s never had Kul Tiran fish stew. The PC and Arator sneak away from duty
for an hour to eat at a local tavern. Arator might laugh and relax, sharing a funny story about how
on the Army of the Light ship, cuisine was just ration packs blessed by the Light (“nutritious but
terribly bland” he jokes). This normal camaraderie cements their friendship beyond battlefield. A GM
note: sometimes having the NPC not be 100% about war (maybe he’s curious about human vs. elf
cultural differences, or asks the PC if they have any family waiting for them, etc.) makes him feel real
and likable. The PC can bond over these conversations. There’s no direct mechanical benefit here,
except that the PC could recover a spent Fate point or stress as a “wind down” if needed, thanks to
the comfort of a friend’s company. 
Aiding Each Other’s Quests: Arator isn’t just an accessory; he has goals too (albeit not grand ones
in BfA). Perhaps he wants to find something of Alleria’s that was left behind when Silvermoon exiled
her – e.g. recover a locket Alleria gave to Lirath (her deceased brother, Arator’s uncle) from the
Windrunner Spire in Ghostlands. The PC can accompany Arator on this personal errand (maybe Act
IV side quest). They sneak into Ghostlands (Horde might spot them – potential tension). At
Windrunner Spire, Arator pays respects to his ancestors. If the PC helps navigate dangers (lingering
banshees or dark rangers possibly there on Sylvanas’s behalf), Arator is deeply grateful. He might
confide feelings about his aunt Sylvanas: “I wish I could have known her as she was before. Now…
now I fear it’s too late.” The PC can counsel him, which might foreshadow how to deal with Sylvanas• 
• 
15

in the endgame (if the PC has a plan to spare/kill her, Arator’s perspective might influence them or
vice versa). Mechanically, accomplishing Arator’s mini-quest could grant the PC a free invoke in the
final Act when dealing with Windrunner matters (like convincing Vereesa or even getting through to
Sylvanas, citing the family and hope – Arator’s experience lends emotional weight). 
Mutual Encouragement: In the darkest hour of Act V (say the skies turn red with N’Zoth’s corruption
or when news comes that Saurfang fell in Mak’gora, leaving uncertain peace), Arator seeks out the
PC. He might be on the verge of despair or simply uncertainty. For instance, if Anduin is missing or
wounded at that time, Arator voices concern: “So much rests on so few… It’s hard to see the Light
when all seems lost.” If the PC has become a mentor figure, they rally Arator with a pep talk,
reminding him of how far he’s come and how his parents endured much worse and still prevailed.
Conversely, if the PC is demoralized, Arator – now grown in confidence – returns the favor. He could
say something surprisingly wise (echoing perhaps something the PC told him earlier, showing he
learned): “Remember what you told me about hope, $PCName$. We have to hold onto it now.” This
mutual support can be reflected by a scene aspect “Bolstered by Friendship” that each can invoke
once in the final conflict. It’s a payoff for developing a genuine bond – neither faces the end alone. 
If a Romance Arc is in play (see below), those bonding moments would carry extra weight, but even
platonically it’s about two comrades lifting each other up.
Romance Arc (Optional & Wholesome): Arator has no canonical love interest during BfA, and as a young
man of noble heart he is certainly an eligible bachelor. A romance with Arator is possible if it fits the PC’s
character and the story’s tone. It should be a tender, slow-build romance founded on mutual respect and
idealism. It’s most fitting for a PC close to his age and within the Alliance (cross-faction star-crossed love is
dramatic but very hard to manage in a war; still, if a neutral meeting happened, who knows – but we’ll
assume Alliance PC for simplicity). 
Progression of a possible romance with Arator: 
Subtle Beginnings: In the early trust-building scenes (like the sparring or tavern meal), sprinkle
small hints. Perhaps Arator blushes slightly when the PC praises him, or he’s a bit flustered if the PC
tends to a wound on his arm (“Th-thank you”). The GM can describe his earnest admiration that
could be interpreted as infatuation. The PC might likewise find his combination of humility and
courage endearing. Nothing overt yet – just groundwork. 
Kindred Souls (mid-campaign): If the PC reciprocates interest (flirtation or just emotional
closeness), Arator confides more deeply. One quiet evening under the stars (maybe aboard the 
Vindicaar orbiting Azeroth, with a viewport showing the Twisting Nether), Arator shares a childhood
memory: how he used to gaze at the stars wondering if his parents were out there, praying to the
Light to reunite them. He then says softly, “I don’t usually share this… I suppose I feel comfortable
with you.” This intimacy is a pivot. If the PC gently takes his hand or offers comfort, Arator realizes
his feelings. He might squeeze the PC’s hand, words failing him as his heart races. They watch the
stars in silence, hand in hand. This is a clear point where the romance is mutual. (Mechanically, one
could give the PC an aspect “Arator’s Devotion” at this point, to invoke in protective situations – e.g.
Arator fights even more fiercely to protect the PC if they’re in danger.) 
Declaration (Act V or Epilogue): Given the war context, an open declaration likely waits until a
respite or victory. Perhaps after Sylvanas flees Orgrimmar and the Alliance/Horde begin their
armistice, there’s a moment in the ruined Lordaeron courtyard (or any meaningful location): Arator
and the PC search for something (e.g. recovering bodies or planting a Alliance banner). They end up
alone in a solemn, hopeful scene. Arator, inspired by the hard-won peace, finally speaks plainly:• 
• 
• 
• 
16

“Through all this war, your presence has been my guiding star. I… I’ve come to care for you. Deeply.”
Depending on PC’s response, this could lead to a gentle first kiss amid the quiet aftermath of war, or
simply a mutual acknowledgement to explore a relationship in peacetime. He might even add with a
light laugh, “I think Father already suspects,” implying Turalyon gave a knowing smile earlier – which
can be a sweet humorous beat. If the PC reciprocates, Arator is overjoyed in his sincere way. If the PC
gently declines or is unsure, Arator will gracefully accept, remaining a close friend without
bitterness. (He’s mature for his age and values the PC too much to jeopardize the bond.) 
Romance Benefits: Should the romance fully bloom, the PC gains the Aspect “Beloved of Arator”. This can
be invoked for strength when defending each other or fighting together. For example, if the PC is in peril,
Arator might pull off a desperate heroic move to save them – the PC can invoke Beloved of Arator to
automatically succeed on a defense once (narrating that Arator intercepted the blow, perhaps taking a hit
for them). Conversely, if Arator is about to be struck down, the PC can invoke it to gain +2 on an attack
against his attacker or on an overcome to reach him in time. Essentially, their love manifests as fierce
protection. Outside of combat, this aspect might come into play in social situations too: being Arator’s
beloved means having the favor of Turalyon and Alleria (once they inevitably find out, Alleria is teasingly
delighted, Turalyon gives a warm fatherly approval). The PC might get invited to the Windrunner family
dinner (imagine that awkwardness if Sylvanas’s name comes up!). The GM can allow an invoke when dealing
with other Alliance leaders who admire the Fordragon/Windrunner line – e.g. Jaina or Genn trust the PC a
bit more knowing they’re practically family friends with Turalyon.
One must maintain the lore-consistency: Arator’s romance with the PC is entirely non-canonical, but it
doesn’t conflict with anything since Arator has no established partner. It’s a sweet addition that doesn’t
affect major events. If the campaign extends beyond BfA, the GM might include Arator in future expansions
(maybe Arator and the PC adventure together in Shadowlands, or he goes with Alleria and Turalyon to quell
some void outbreak, etc.). The key is to keep it in-character: Arator’s love is sincere, gallant, and somewhat
idealized (he likely writes the PC letters or poems reminiscent of his half-elven heritage, maybe even asking
Vereesa for advice on courtship!). It can provide some heartwarming respite in an otherwise grim wartime
story.
GM Integration & Notes: Arator is best used in the campaign as a companion NPC in more personal, small-
scale scenes rather than leading armies. He can fill the role of the “friendly junior hero” who tags along on a
mission where Anduin or other big names are too busy to send. For example: - During the Alliance quests in
Nazmir (if the Alliance PC goes to help retrieve a lost expedition), Turalyon might say “Arator, go with
$PCName$ and ensure our soldiers return safely.” Arator then accompanies the PC through a creepy
swamp, offering commentary and help. - He might pop up during the Siege of Orgrimmar epilogue: when
the PC stands amid the victory, Arator runs up and hugs them (especially if romance, but even as friends)
saying “We did it!” – highlighting the emotional relief of the youth. - Also consider correspondence: if the PC
is distant, the GM could give them a “Letter from Arator” between acts, where he writes about his thoughts
(this is great to show his feelings and maintain connection if he’s not physically present in a particular act).
Rewards Recap: Aside from the Brother-in-Arms aspect, there aren’t heavy gear rewards from Arator’s arc
(given his age and position, he’s not handing out artifacts willy-nilly). However, one possible tangible reward:
- Elven Tagger – a small Farstrider talisman Arator carries, crafted by Vereesa’s high elves for him. It’s
essentially a charm that can emit a brief flash of blue ranger’s light visible only to allies, used to signal
across distances. After the trust arc, he gifts it to the PC: “Take this – Aunt Vereesa gave me this signaling
charm, but I think you’ll have more need of it in your adventures.” Mechanics: Once per session, the PC can
invoke “Farstrider Signal” to either call for help (and narratively, an ally or escape appears if plausible) or to
17

locate a hidden ally (the charm glows when pointing towards a nearby friend). It’s a minor but flavorful item.
- Additionally, Title (informal): If Turalyon is aware of how the PC mentored Arator, he might jokingly refer to
the PC as “Arator’s Battle-Brother/Sister.” It’s not an official title, but coming from the High Exarch it sticks –
soldiers might salute the PC with a grin because they’ve heard the tales of how the PC and Arator fought
side by side. This is mostly narrative color.
By the end of BfA, Arator’s arc with the PC should feel like one of mutual growth: the once-uncertain half-elf
stands taller, inspired by the PC, and the PC in turn has gained a steadfast friend (or lover) who symbolizes
hope for the future. In the grim tapestry of war, Arator’s presence and bond with the PC add threads of
light, compassion, and the promise that the next generation (like him) will carry on the fight for a better
world.
Taelia Fordragon (Alliance)
Psychological Profile: Taelia Fordragon is a courageous young knight of Kul Tiras with a proud lineage –
unbeknownst to her for most of her life, she is the daughter of the legendary Bolvar Fordragon (former
Regent of Stormwind, now the Lich King). Raised as a ward of House Proudmoore in Kul Tiras, Taelia
grew up idolizing the father she was told died a hero at the Wrath Gate. This instilled in her a strong
sense of duty, honor, and a desire to live up to the Fordragon name (even if she didn’t use it publicly).
Taelia’s motivation is two-fold: to defend Kul Tiras and the Alliance from any threat, and to uncover and honor
her family legacy. She hopes to one day make her father proud (not knowing he lives on in a grim fate) and
to protect those who cannot protect themselves, as Bolvar once did. Her fear is failing her people or losing
those she cares about – she already lost her father (so she thinks) and dreads losing another loved one to
war or monsters. Personality-wise, Taelia is determined, hearty, and compassionate. She trained among
seasoned soldiers (the Proudmoore Guard) and developed a bit of a tomboyish, no-nonsense attitude. She
can drink and laugh with the sailors, she’s unafraid to speak her mind (for instance, she initially challenges
the Alliance PC to prove themselves worthy to Jaina’s cause). Yet she also has a vulnerable side: mention of
her father or the lullaby her mother sang can soften her brash exterior, revealing the girl who quietly misses
family. She’s generally friendly and supportive to those who earn her respect. In BfA’s story, Taelia plays a
key role in guiding the Alliance Champion through Kul Tiras. She meets the PC right after they arrive in
Boralus – essentially acting as their first ally in a hostile city. She helps them navigate the kingdom’s politics
and later fights by their side (notably in the Battle of Proudmoore Keep to free Jaina). After Kul Tiras rejoins
the Alliance, Taelia travels to Stormwind with Jaina, where Anduin Wrynn eventually informs her of Bolvar’s
fate (this reveal actually happens in off-screen lore before Shadowlands: she learns her father became the
new Lich King, which angers and upsets her greatly). During BfA, she doesn’t know that truth yet, so she still
reveres Bolvar’s memory. Taelia is very much a squire-knight archetype: eager to prove herself, dutiful in
following orders, but also willing to challenge superiors if morality demands (for example, she’d object to
any dishonorable tactics used by Alliance forces, being raised on stories of honor). She’s an excellent fighter –
plate armor, shield and sword, trained in the Stormwind and Kul Tiran styles (so a mix of disciplined
footman drills and naval combat techniques). She also has a connection to Tidesage magic academically
(Cyrus Crestfall, her mentor, likely taught her basics about winds and waves), though she’s not a mage. PCs
will find Taelia to be a stalwart companion: protective, upbeat in dire moments, and someone who values
teamwork and camaraderie. If anything, she can sometimes be headstrong – charging ahead at times or
stubbornly insisting to partake in dangerous fights (for instance, she refuses to sit idle when Ashvane’s coup
happens; she jumps into the fray with the PC). Emotions to explore: her grief and anger regarding her
father (initially aimed at the Horde, especially the Forsaken who were involved at Wrath Gate), her loyalty to24
2526
18

Katherine and Jaina Proudmoore (Taelia sees Katherine like a foster mother), and possibly her sense of
identity (as she grapples with being both a Kul Tiran knight and Bolvar’s daughter from Stormwind). She’s a
bridge between Kul Tiras and the mainland Alliance, just as the PC might be the bridge between Alliance
and Horde in the larger narrative. In summary, Taelia is brave, kind-hearted, a bit fiery, and deeply tied to
the themes of legacy and family in the Alliance storyline.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept – “Kul Tiran Knight and Proud Daughter” (trained warrior of Kul Tiras, carries the
Fordragon spirit unknowingly). Trouble – “Burdened by a Hero’s Legacy” (feels pressure of her father’s
sacrifice; can react strongly to mentions of sacrifice or undead due to Bolvar). Other Aspects – “Steel and
Saltwater” (hardened by naval life and battle, she’s tough and resourceful), “Heart of the Storm” (courageous,
charges into danger to protect others, as fierce as a gale). These aspects reflect her martial prowess,
upbringing at sea, emotional drive from her father’s story, and fearless protective nature.
- Approaches: Forceful +3, Careful +2, Quick +2, Flashy +1, Clever +1, Sneaky +0. (Taelia fights Forcefully –
shield up, taking blows, and hitting hard. She’s also fairly Careful, having military discipline and being
trained to follow plans. At sea one learns to act Quick when needed (e.g. tying down rigging in a storm, or
dodging an ogre’s strike), so she’s quick on her feet in armor. She’s not one for deception or subtlety – direct
and honest, hence Sneaky 0. Flashy she can be when rallying troops with a bold shout or showing heraldry,
but it’s not her focus. Clever strategy she usually leaves to higher-ups, but she’s no dummy either, just
average in cunning tactics.)
- Stunts: Fordragon Shield Wall: Because Taelia bears a heavy shield and the fortitude of Bolvar’s line, she
gets +2 to Carefully defend an ally who is adjacent to her in battle. If an ally next to Taelia is attacked, she can
interpose her shield with a shout (“Behind me!”), granting this bonus on her defend roll (and if successful,
she negates or takes the hit instead of the ally). Naval Veteran’s Endurance: Once per session, Taelia can
call upon her conditioning from years on deck and in battle to ignore fatigue or pain. She can treat a
Moderate physical consequence as Mild for the duration of a scene (fluff: she “pushes through” with grit).
After the scene, the consequence returns to normal severity (she’ll feel the full pain once adrenaline wears
off). Tidesage’s Favor (Minor): Having grown up around Tidesages, Taelia knows small blessings. She can
Cleverly create an advantage once per scene related to weather or sea lore. For example, “Tailwind at our
Backs” for a ship chase or “Mud Underfoot” by predicting a tidal flat’s slickness in a battle near the coast.
Mechanically, it’s a +2 to creating an aspect involving environmental conditions (rain, wind, waves) –
narrative justification is she prays to the sea for aid or uses her knowledge to exploit conditions. It’s not
outright spellcasting, more intuition and minor charms taught by sailors.
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 3, Mental 2. Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate (4). (Taelia is in prime
physical shape, able to weather physical punishment in heavy armor. Mentally she’s strong-willed but not
exceptionally trained against, say, fear magic or manipulation – though her confidence is growing. She has
no special mental consequence slots beyond normal. Notably, if confronted with very personal trauma (like
news of Bolvar’s fate), the GM could hit her with a mental consequence representing her shock, which
aligns with lore when she learns the truth.)
Trust-Building Questline: Gaining Taelia’s trust comes quite naturally during the Kul Tiras storyline –
indeed, in canon she and the Alliance PC become close allies. But here we expand it into a deeper
companion arc. Key themes: proving honor and friendship, supporting her through family revelations,
and giving her reasons to believe in the PC as a leader/partner beyond Kul Tiras. This questline
primarily concerns an Alliance PC (Horde PCs won’t have extended contact with Taelia until perhaps after
19

war via cross-faction events, which would be unusual – although a Horde PC who defected or was a neutral
might meet her in the context of Bolvar’s plot in Shadowlands, but that’s beyond BfA). Here are milestones:
Stormwinds and Introductions (Act II – Arrival in Kul Tiras): The PC first encounters Taelia when
they’re delivered (half in chains, if Jaina’s plan holds) to Boralus. Taelia storms the holding cell area to
liberate the PC on Cyrus’s orders, fighting off some overly hostile guards. This event already shows
her mettle. The trust milestone here is how the PC conducts themselves during the chaotic escape
from the prison and across Boralus rooftops. If the PC keeps cool under pressure, fights
alongside Taelia effectively, and perhaps even saves a Kul Tiran citizen or one of Taelia’s fellow
guards during the chase, Taelia is impressed. For instance, a loose cannon skiff (boat) might break
free and threaten to crush a bystander; the PC deviates to secure it or pull someone to safety. Taelia
notices and gives an approving grin amid the action. By the time they reach the Snug Harbor Inn
hideout, Taelia’s initial wariness (“Let’s see what you’re made of”) is replaced with respect. She claps
the PC on the shoulder: “Not bad, [mate] (Kul Tiran slang). I’ve known seasoned sailors with less grit.”
This establishes a foundation of trust. (If conversely the PC acted recklessly, insulting Kul Tiras or
dismissing Taelia’s help, her trust would start lower. She might grumble to Cyrus that the PC is
arrogant or uncooperative. It would take more effort later to mend that impression.) 
Anchors Aweigh (Act II – Questing in Kul Tiras): Throughout the questlines in Tiragarde Sound,
Drustvar, and Stormsong, Taelia often accompanies or at least gives guidance. The pivotal trust
moment can be framed during the Siege of Boralus dungeon/assault when Lady Ashvane launches
her coup. Taelia and the PC find themselves fighting side by side in the streets of Boralus, defending
civilians from Ashvane’s loyalist thugs and freed pirates. One key scene: A young child is trapped in a
burning building set ablaze by Ashvane’s forces. Taelia immediately moves to rush in, but debris
blocks the way. She calls for the PC’s help. If the PC bravely aids her – maybe boosting Taelia up to
a window or working together to clear a path – they rescue the child (and perhaps the child’s mother
who was frantically trying to reach them). After collapsing outside, coughing from smoke, Taelia
takes off her cloak to wrap the child, showing her nurturing side. She looks at the PC with genuine
gratitude and admiration, “I couldn’t have done that without you.” This is a more emotional bond
moment; Taelia sees the PC not just as a capable warrior but a kindred spirit who values innocent
lives like she does. Trust deepens. (If the PC prioritized fighting or another objective over the rescue,
maybe Taelia does it alone and succeeds but with injury. She won’t scold the PC mid-crisis, but
afterward her demeanor would be cooler – she might say curtly, “The people come first. Remember
that,” which indicates the PC lost points in her eyes. To regain that, the PC might need to do
something later like help a bunch of civilians voluntarily.) 
A Daughter’s Heart (Act III – After Siege of Boralus, Kul Tiras joins Alliance): With Jaina rescued
and Ashvane defeated, Taelia’s formal duties ease a bit. She travels to Stormwind with the
Proudmoores. Here, Anduin and Jaina arrange a meeting: Taelia learns about Bolvar Fordragon –
first the official story (his heroism and death at Wrath Gate). Since the PC knew Bolvar or at least of
him, they could be present or supporting Taelia. A trust milestone here is personal: how the PC helps
Taelia process this revelation. For example, Anduin might give Taelia Bolvar’s old Stormwind tabard
or shield, as a token from his effects. Taelia, emotional, steps outside into Stormwind’s Cathedral
Square for air. The PC can follow; they find her looking at the shield with trembling hands. If the PC
shares a respectful, empathetic moment – perhaps they recount a brief story of Bolvar if they ever
met him (for instance, “I was there at the Battle of Angrathar. Your father saved us all… He was the
bravest man I’ve ever known.”). Or if not firsthand, the PC simply reassures her that Bolvar’s
sacrifice meant something, that everyone in the Alliance honors his name. This means the world to
Taelia. She might have tears in her eyes but smiles: “Thank you. I… I always hoped I’d make him1. 
2. 
3. 
26
20

proud.” She then says to the PC almost solemnly, “Let’s make sure all this – everything we’ve done –
is something he’d be proud of.” That statement marks that she now holds the PC as a close friend
and comrade, someone she trusts with her vulnerable side and her resolve to live up to Bolvar.
(Mechanically, one could mark the trust clock full here). Alternate path: If for some reason the PC
wasn’t empathetic (say they’re very awkward or dismissive in emotional situations), Taelia might
bottle it up. Trust might not max yet, and she could even snap, “I just… need a moment alone.” The
PC would have to regain ground maybe in the next step by being there for her in action since words
failed. But likely players will console her.)
With Trust filled, Taelia truly considers the PC her dear friend and battle-partner. She even defers to their
leadership in situations (e.g. if PC has a plan in war councils, she’ll back it enthusiastically). At this stage,
Taelia might start addressing the PC by first name or a friendly nickname rather than “sir/ma’am” or title.
She may also open up about her mother (who is presumably dead or missing; Bolvar’s wife was killed in the
Scourge invasion of Stormwind long ago – perhaps Taelia has only faint memories, but that’s another layer
of loss). The PC, in essence, becomes the person Taelia feels she can be Taelia, not just “Squire Fordragon,”
around.
Bonding Arc (Mentorship & Sisterhood/Brotherhood): Unlike Arator, Taelia is not really looking for a
mentor – she’s pretty self-sufficient and trained. Instead this arc is more about peer bonding and mutual
support, with the PC possibly helping guide her through adapting to the wider world beyond Kul Tiras and
the revelations about her lineage. Some scenes:
City of Stormwind Tour: The PC can show Taelia around Stormwind (since she’s new to the
mainland’s capital). This can be a charming roleplay scene. Taelia marvels at the statues in the Valley
of Heroes, including one of Bolvar (if one exists in the Park or Cathedral district). She asks the PC
questions about life in Stormwind, maybe tries Stormwind’s famous meat pie or visits the training
yard where young knights drill. As they walk the streets, some citizens recognize the Fordragon
resemblance or have heard the rumor of Bolvar’s daughter. An old veteran approaches and salutes
Taelia, thanking her because “Bolvar was a great man – we’re all in your debt through him.” Taelia is
humble, perhaps a bit overwhelmed, and looks to the PC for how to respond (the PC can encourage
her to accept the respect gracefully, maybe by sharing a toast or a prayer at Cathedral for Bolvar).
This grounds Taelia in the Alliance community and the PC is at her side throughout, strengthening
their camaraderie. 
Training Exchange – Tidal vs. Land Tactics: The PC and Taelia spar or train, exchanging fighting
techniques. Taelia might show the PC a Kul Tiran maneuver – for example, a shield push that mimics
the timing of a ship rising on a wave, useful for unbalancing foes (could be fluff or an advantage
created). The PC in turn might show her a tactic from their repertoire (maybe a trick to fighting the
Horde’s typical strategies or a combo move). Mechanically, you could treat this as each creating an
advantage aspect on the other (each gets a boost like “Taught Taelia X” and “Learned Kul Tiran Y”).
Narratively, it’s a fun scene of two friends training, possibly trying to one-up each other a bit (Taelia’s
competitive side could appear: “Bet you 5 gold I can disarm you in under 10 seconds!”). If romance is
possible, this could even have a slight flirty vibe (see Romance arc below). Otherwise it’s healthy
rivalry. 
Facing the Undead (Act IV – Horde’s Use of Plague / Nazmir excursion): Taelia has a personal
hatred for undead given Bolvar’s fate at Wrath Gate (though she doesn’t know he became the Lich
King, she knows he died to the Forsaken’s plague). In any battle where the PC and Taelia fight
undead (e.g. in Nazmir against Blood Troll necromancy, or during the assault on Zul’Dazar where
some necro alchemy is used, or the War Campaign quest where Alliance confront San’layn vampires• 
• 
• 
21

allied with Sylvanas), Taelia might become fiercely intense. Possibly she overextends in anger if, say,
a Forsaken apothecary taunts “We made your father melt, girl!” The PC can step in to prevent her
from doing something rash (like nearly executing a surrendering apothecary out of rage). Afterward,
Taelia thanks the PC for keeping her grounded: “I almost lost myself back there. I just – I hate that
plague, what it did to my father… I never want anyone to suffer that.” The PC talking her down in the
moment and comforting her after strengthens their trust. It also sets up her arc for Shadowlands
nicely (where she confronts the concept of undeath in Bolvar). But in BfA, the PC is the one who
helps her channel her pain into righteousness rather than vengeance. This could give the PC a free
invoke on an aspect “Level-Headed” for Taelia in later battles (meaning she will act with clear mind
thanks to the PC’s influence). Conversely, if the PC had let her or encouraged her to be brutal, she
might have regretted it – causing a temporary rift (“That’s not the kind of knight I want to be…”).
Ideally, the PC plays the positive role model here, especially if they are an Alliance paladin or
someone who understands controlled anger.
Romance Arc: A romance with Taelia is quite plausible and potentially very heartfelt. By the end of BfA,
fandom speculated a bit about Anduin and Taelia possibly having an interest (they meet in BfA’s finale and
have a brief friendly interaction). But nothing concrete in lore. This leaves Taelia open for a PC romance
without contradicting canon (as long as one assumes she and Anduin remain just friends in this timeline).
She’s around twenties, the PC could be any gender (Taelia’s orientation isn’t stated; presumably straight if
the Anduin hints were meant, but one could allow flexibility if desired). We’ll assume a male PC for
example’s sake, but it can work similarly with a female PC as a close bond, albeit Blizzard hasn’t depicted her
as explicitly queer (GM’s choice how to handle).
A romance with Taelia would develop from the strong friendship above, with additional sparks: - Shared
Heritage Moments: If the PC is also of Stormwind or similar background, they can bond over talk of home.
If the PC is from elsewhere, Taelia is curious about their homeland. Over late-night chats in the Boralus
tavern or on the deck of a ship to Nazjatar, they find themselves laughing, sharing personal dreams beyond
war. Taelia admits she dreams of one day rebuilding Fordragon Keep (Bolvar’s ancestral hold, maybe ruined
in the Third War) or something symbolic like that. The PC might share their own post-war dream. Realizing
they envision futures, possibly together, can spark feelings. - Tender Concern: After the battle where Taelia
nearly lost herself against the undead, the PC might check on her that evening. Perhaps at the Stormwind
docks, Taelia stands looking over the dark water lost in thought. The PC approaches, gentle. Taelia confides
her lingering fears (“I talk big about making him proud… but what if I’m not strong enough?”). The PC offers
heartfelt reassurance – maybe taking her hand or shoulder. If the PC shows open affection (like brushing a
tear off her cheek or a warm encouraging smile that lingers), Taelia feels a flutter. She might blush or put
her hand over the PC’s. This could be the first physical sign of mutual attraction. - Declaration under the
Light’s Hope: Near the end of the war, perhaps after the Mak’gora and armistice, the PC and Taelia travel to
Lion’s Rest in Stormwind (the memorial where Varian’s tomb is). Taelia goes to pay respects to Varian (whom
she admired as a kid) and to “speak” to Bolvar’s memory. The PC accompanies. Surrounded by tranquil
white flowers and the statues, Taelia thanks the PC for everything: “I couldn’t have gotten through these
trials without you.” She then, haltingly but bravely, expresses deeper feelings: “In you I’ve found not just a
comrade, but someone I…care for. Greatly.” Depending on PC’s response, this is the romantic resolution.
Ideally the PC reciprocates, leading to a gentle embrace or even a kiss among the solemn peace of the
memorial. It’s private and fitting – Bolvar’s spirit “witnessing” his daughter find someone worthy. If the PC
doesn’t return the love, Taelia will accept it with grace, burying any embarrassment and remaining a loyal
friend (maybe attributing it to war camaraderie confusion). But if reciprocated, they leave Lion’s Rest hand
in hand, hopeful for the future. 
22

Romance Outcome & Benefits: Becoming Taelia’s beloved means gaining a fierce, devoted partner in all
things. The PC would get the Aspect “Bolvar’s Legacy, Taelia’s Love” (just a thematic name). Mechanically,
it could be invoked similar to other romance aspects: for strength when protecting each other, or clout
among Alliance because of their combined legendary heritage. For instance, at a Council meeting, Jaina
might good-naturedly tease Taelia about fussing over the PC’s bandaged wound, but that also means Jaina
trusts the PC even more, seeing how much Taelia (her protégé) loves them. Or the PC can invoke Taelia’s
Love to get an automatic success in saving Taelia from a deadly strike (the power of love compels a heroic
burst!). Story-wise, Jaina and Anduin would definitely notice and approve: Anduin sees it as a bright spot
after war, and perhaps in a letter to the PC (post-campaign) Bolvar’s voice (if somehow reaching out from
the Shadowlands, or maybe Bolvar’s wife Calia Menethil interacts in Shadowlands, different lore but
anyway) expresses happiness that Taelia isn’t alone. If the campaign goes into Shadowlands, that romance
would be a big motivator for the PC to help reunite or mediate between Bolvar and Taelia.
Rewards: Beyond aspects and emotional depth, tangible rewards from Taelia can include: - Fordragon
Family Armor: As the Alliance solidifies peace, Taelia decides to refurbish some of her father’s old armor
(perhaps Bolvar’s secondary breastplate or a shield from the keep) and gives it to the PC. Mechanics: This
item can be an Extra providing +1 armor rating or a once-per-session ability to reduce a Moderate
consequence to Mild (the armor’s legacy strength). She says, “Father would want you to have this. You carry
the same spirit in battle.” (If PC already has superior gear, perhaps she symbolically gifts a Signet Ring of
House Fordragon instead, which could serve as an invoke for commanding respect as needed.) - Title –
“Knight of Kul Tiras” or “Honorary Proudmoore Guard”: Katherine (and Jaina) might, at Taelia’s
suggestion, bestow a ceremonial title linking the PC to Kul Tiras. The PC basically becomes a recognized
knight in both Stormwind and Kul Tiras. This doesn’t change their duties but in narrative, Kul Tirans cheer
them as one of their own, and they can invoke this status when dealing with Kul Tiran crews or resources.
(Taelia literally vouches, “This one’s fought for us as hard as any Tideguard.”) - Unique Mount – Gryphon
“Dawnchaser”: Taelia arranges, perhaps through Tandred Proudmoore (Jaina’s brother who is a
skycaptain), for the PC to receive a Kul Tiran gryphon bred from the Proudmoore aviary. It’s a hearty
gryphon with sea-green plumage. She jokes that since the PC helped her fly on a borrowed gryphon during
a mission, it’s only fair they get one of their own. (Narratively cool, mechanically maybe a +2 to travel
overcome involving flight or just bragging rights.)
GM Guidance: Weave Taelia’s presence mostly in the Alliance-side narrative. During the Breaching of Uldir
or Battle of Dazar’alor arcs, the GM can have her send supportive letters or be busy training Kul Tiran
recruits (so she’s off-stage when focus is elsewhere). She should come back in for climax and epilogue.
Make sure to highlight her emotional arcs: finding out about her father should be a turning point scene
(even if the module didn’t cover it, as GM we can include it as a roleplay segment near the end). If the PC is
Horde, an alternative use: After the war, Taelia might join the neutral gathering in Icecrown (pre-
Shadowlands event) and a Horde PC could meet her there and strike an unlikely friendship over Bolvar’s
situation. But that’s outside BfA timeline. 
With trust and potentially love, Taelia and the PC become one of those great Alliance duos spoken of in
tavern tales: the Knight of the Tides and the Hero of $PC’sHome$, standing shoulder to shoulder against
whatever comes next. In the final moments of the campaign, if the PC is at Anduin’s victory gathering
(perhaps a quiet remembrance ceremony for the fallen), Taelia stands beside them, maybe taking their
hand under the table or exchanging a knowing nod – silently pledging that, come peace or further war, they
will face it together.

Varok Saurfang (Horde)
Psychological Profile: High Overlord Varok Saurfang is an aged orc warrior embodying the honor and
tragedy of the Horde. A veteran of countless wars (First through Fourth), Saurfang is revered among orcs –
and even respected by Alliance – for his integrity and prowess. By BfA, he is weary and haunted: the
massacre at Teldrassil, carried out under Sylvanas’s orders, broke something in him. His motivation
becomes to restore the Horde’s honor and soul, even if it costs him his life. He hopes the Horde can be
freed from Sylvanas’s tyranny and return to its roots of honorable combat and true camaraderie. He
also privately hopes his death will atone for his past failures (like not preventing his son Dranosh’s demise,
or the atrocities committed under Garrosh and now Sylvanas). He fears the Horde losing itself to darkness –
becoming no better than demons or Scourge – and he fears that he personally will die dishonored or that
his actions will be in vain. Personality-wise, Saurfang is gruff, blunt, and stoic, but with a deep well of
wisdom and feeling beneath. He doesn’t waste words, often responding with a grunt or a single sage
sentence. Yet he feels deeply: the loss of his son at the Wrath Gate, the genocide of the Night Elves, these
weigh on every line of his scarred face. In early BfA, he complies with Sylvanas out of duty (War of
Thorns), but after Teldrassil burns, he openly despairs (“What have we done?”). At Lordaeron, he allows
himself to be captured by the Alliance, preferring imprisonment (or death) over aiding Sylvanas’s
dishonorable war. That’s where the Old Soldier cinematic portrays him – ready to die until a young troll
(Zekhan) rekindles his will to fight for a better Horde. From that point, Saurfang becomes the conscience of
the Horde rebellion. He is extremely honorable: will not kill without purpose, spares civilians, rejects
underhanded tactics (like blight or raising undead). Saurfang’s interactions with a PC depend on their
values: if the PC shows honor, Saurfang treats them like a respected fellow warrior (even if they’re young). If
they show cruelty or blind obedience to Sylvanas, he will be curt or disappointed. He has a particularly
complex relationship if the PC is an orc – he almost takes on an uncle-like mentorship to younger orcs who
seek the old ways. If the PC is Alliance, Saurfang actually interacts (Anduin frees him, etc.), and he respects
individual Alliance heroes who show mercy or honor (like not executing him on the spot). In such cases,
Saurfang can build a rare mutual respect across faction lines (Anduin and he share that). Key traits:
unwavering courage (he’ll face impossible odds rather than run), deep loyalty to the Horde ideal (not its
current warchief), and a streak of self-sacrifice. By Act III/IV, he’s absolutely willing to die to set things right –
which he indeed does in Mak’gora. A PC will find Saurfang a stern but fair ally, who gives blunt advice,
praises with small nods, and may challenge them morally if they waver from honor. If the PC is Horde, siding
with him means he treats them almost like a second chance at having a protégé (his own son is gone, so
perhaps he subconsciously fills that void by guiding young heroes). If PC is Alliance, he comes to see them
as honorable adversaries or even co-belligerents against Sylvanas in the later stages. In either case,
emotional moments revolve around his past: mention of Dranosh (his son) can crack his voice, and seeing
something like the atrocity in Darkshore fills him with sorrowful anger. He often gazes at the axe of his
brother Broxigar (which he carries) or a trinket of his son’s, lost in thought. The PC who stands by Saurfang
should be prepared for tough love mentorship and the ultimate heartbreak of his death – but also the
meaningful inspiration that death provides the Horde.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept – “Veteran Orc Chieftain Seeking Honor” (legendary warrior, former General,
upholding old Horde honor). Trouble – “Weighed Down by Loss and Guilt” (haunted by the death of his son,
the dishonor at Teldrassil, and many fallen comrades – can lead him to take burdens solely on himself or
despair). Other – “Heart of the True Horde” (he embodies the noble, self-sacrificing spirit of the Horde; can
inspire others by example), “Last of the Old Guard” (one of the few surviving old heroes, he has
perspective and stubborn traditionalism in equal measure). These aspects reflect his storied past, inner2728

turmoil, inspirational presence, and adherence to honorable combat.
- Approaches: Forceful +4, Careful +3, Flashy +1, Quick +1, Clever +2, Sneaky +0. (Saurfang is immensely
Forceful – few hit harder or endure more on the front lines. He’s also Careful tactically; decades of war
taught him to plan and watch for traps. He’s not particularly flashy – he leads by action, not showmanship.
He can be Clever on the battlefield, recalling strategies, but he’s no political schemer. Quick – he’s older,
perhaps not as fast as younger fighters, but still has warrior reflexes. Sneaky – absolutely not; Saurfang
fights openly and directly.)
- Stunts: Cleave the Horde’s Foe: Wielding his mighty axe, Saurfang can once per conflict Forcefully attack
two targets at once with a single swing (split his dice between two foes, effectively). Thanks to his legendary
strength, he doesn’t suffer the usual -2 for a second target – he can hit two enemies hard in one broad arc.
Challenge of Honor: Saurfang can issue a Forceful challenge (Create Advantage) to a single enemy
commander: “Mak’gora!” or an orcish duel. Once per scene, he forces an enemy of note to focus on him (if
they accept, social/magical pressures might make them do so). This places the aspect “Honor Duel
Engaged” on the field. Mechanically, as long as that enemy fights him one-on-one, Saurfang gains +2 on
his first attack due to determination, and neither side’s allies will interfere (could compel others not to
interfere). Second Wind of the Warrior: When Saurfang takes a physical consequence, he may immediately
roar and clear his 3-point physical stress box if it’s available (narratively, he’s pushing through pain by sheer
will). This effectively gives him a brief resurgence after being wounded (once per session). He often did
this in lore – e.g. standing back up after being knocked down, driven by inner fire.
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 4 (with an extra Mild 2 physical consequence slot, reflecting orcish
resilience and his pain tolerance ), Mental 3. Consequences: Mild (2) x2, Moderate (4), Severe (6).
(Saurfang can take a tremendous beating and still stand – hence two mild physical slots, one possibly from
high Physique/Will per Fate rules. Mentally, he’s strong-willed but emotionally bruised; extreme
psychological stress like Sylvanas’s cruel taunts or the death of a protégé could give him a mental
consequence e.g. “Haunted by Ghosts of the Past” which crafty foes might invoke.)
Trust-Building Questline: For Horde PCs, earning Saurfang’s trust is one of the central arcs of BfA,
paralleling the choice to support his rebellion. It involves demonstrating Honor, Courage, and Loyalty to
the Horde’s ideals over personal glory or blind obedience. For Alliance PCs, “trust” manifests as respect –
Saurfang won’t fully trust an Alliance character with Horde secrets, but he might trust in their personal
honor (like he did with Anduin). We can address both: primarily assume a Horde PC path with notes on
Alliance alternatives.
Milestones (Horde perspective):
A Warrior’s Remorse (Act I – After Teldrassil): In the aftermath of the Burning of Teldrassil,
Saurfang is devastated. If the PC is Horde, they likely participated in War of Thorns. When Sylvanas
gives the order to burn the tree, Saurfang visibly objects but it’s too late. Many Horde PCs felt uneasy
too. If the PC took any action to mitigate the horror – e.g. they helped evacuate some civilians or
refused to kill non-combatants – Saurfang notices. Maybe the PC pulled back a younger grunt from
executing a child, or they secretly ferried a few Night Elf refugees out of the fire. Saurfang later
confronts the PC in Darkshore’s edge: not angrily, quietly. “I saw what you did,” he rumbles. If the PC
defends their mercy, Saurfang gives a slow nod of approval. “There is no honor in this massacre,” he
says, effectively agreeing with the PC’s instincts. This exchange (even if done in few words, or
even silent mutual understanding with a meeting of eyes amid the chaos) seeds trust: the PC values
honor as he does. Mark first trust segment. (If the PC enthusiastically burned civilians, then
Saurfang’s trust plummets – he’ll likely glare with contempt and not speak to them unless they later30
31
32
1. 
28
25

have a change of heart. The questline then would require the PC to sincerely repent or demonstrate
change at a later point, like helping Saurfang in Act II despite having been on Sylvanas’s side – a
more difficult path to his trust.) 
Prisoner’s Dilemma (Act II – Rescue from Stockades or Breakout): After Lordaeron, Saurfang is in
Alliance prison (the Stockades). The PC might be involved in releasing him depending on their
choices. Horde-side, Sylvanas dispatches a rogue to assassinate Saurfang in prison (in one war
campaign quest). If the PC is present and instead helps Saurfang escape or fights off the
assassin, that’s a huge trust gain. For instance, say the PC (hearing of Sylvanas’s foul play) infiltrates
Stormwind not to kill him (as ordered) but to warn Saurfang. They might face conflict with loyalist
agents and free Saurfang, delivering him to a safe meeting with Zekhan or Alliance turncoats.
Saurfang, shocked that a Horde champion defied Sylvanas to save him, almost can’t believe it. “You
risked death for me... Why?” If the PC professes that the Horde needs him, or that Teldrassil was
wrong and they believe in his vision, Saurfang’s stern facade cracks. He clasps their shoulder with
pride. “Maybe the next generation hasn’t lost its honor after all,” he says softly. From this point, he
regards the PC as a true comrade. (Mechanically, trust clock almost full here because that’s a big
move.) Alliance variation: Anduin canonically frees Saurfang, but imagine the PC is with Anduin. If
the PC argued for Saurfang’s release or treated Saurfang respectfully in captivity (maybe visited his
cell just to talk honor to honor), Saurfang notes it. When leaving with Anduin’s help, he’d give an
Alliance PC a small respectful nod or even return a confiscated Alliance dagger to them hilt-first (a
sign of trust). That respect can be paid off later if alliance PC meets him again (like at the siege of
Orgrimmar parley, he might tell his guards “let them through, I know this one fights with honor”). 
For the True Horde (Act III – Rebel Recruitment at Razor Hill): Saurfang, now free, moves openly
to rally supporters (the “Honor Horde”) at Razor Hill in Durotar. If the PC (Horde) chooses to join
Saurfang’s rebels at this pivotal choice, that is the defining trust moment. In-game, Horde players
literally had to choose Sylvanas or Saurfang in 8.2 – here if the PC goes with Saurfang, they prove
where their loyalty lies. Saurfang welcomes them with a solemn nod and perhaps a rare smile: “You
choose honor, $PCName$. The Horde... the Horde is stronger for it.” He might then initiate a warrior’s
oath ritual. For example, he and the PC could clasp forearms and Saurfang recites an orcish vow:
“Let our blades be sharpened by the same cause, our blood spill together if need be, until we restore
the heart of the Horde.” The PC responding in kind seals it. This likely completes the trust clock –
Saurfang now treats the PC as one of his closest, trusting them with sensitive tasks (like rescuing
Baine). After this, he will consult the PC for advice in war councils (their voice is valued like Zekhan,
Thalyssra, etc.). Alternate (Alliance): Come Act III/IV, Alliance PC might fight alongside Saurfang’s
rebellion during the Battle of Orgrimmar (Anduin’s joint plan). If earlier respect was established,
Saurfang might specifically ask the Alliance PC during war prep: “You have fought against my people
with honor. Now fight with us with honor.” Working together in the final battle, the Alliance PC can earn
his full trust (as much as a non-Horde can). At the gates, perhaps the PC has an opportunity to, say,
stop a dishonorable blow from interfering in Saurfang’s Mak’gora (like an enemy forsaken tries to
shoot Saurfang from behind and Alliance PC intercepts). Saurfang, seeing that, gives a deep grateful
bow of his head before he faces Sylvanas. It’s wordless trust, but profound. 
When Trust is filled, Saurfang and the PC share a bond forged in battle and principle. Reward: For a Horde
PC, the obvious “reward” is less tangible and more meaningful: Saurfang’s open commendation. After
Sylvanas flees and the smoke clears, Saurfang (if he survived in some AU where PC intervention stops
Sylvanas from killing him, or in ghostly form if not – but let’s assume he still dies as in canon) will have
publicly called the PC and others “the true Horde.” In his final speech prior to Mak’gora, Saurfang could
shout something referencing the PC: “The Horde’s future lies with brave souls like $PCName$, who carry its
honor!”. Mechanical reward: The PC gains an Aspect “Champion of Nagrand’s Honor” or “Saurfang’s2. 
3. 
28
26

Esteem”. This can be invoked whenever the PC tries to rally Horde forces or call upon the old ways. For
example, if the PC later tries to stop a revenge killing by citing “What would Saurfang say?”, the aspect gives
+2 because many Horde remember Saurfang’s sacrifice and will heed those invoking his legacy. Also, the
new Horde leadership (Thrall, Baine, etc.) recognize the PC as instrumental in the rebellion. The PC might be
offered a formal title like “Honorbound of Orgrimmar” (a non-canon title meaning they exemplify the
Honor Horde). Narratively this could mean the PC is asked to ceremonially light Saurfang’s funeral pyre or
given the honor of carrying his shattered axe in the procession. They become part of Horde history. 
Betrayal/Alternate Outcome: If at any point the PC betrays Saurfang – say they feign joining him then later
turn him in to Sylvanas (some players did follow Sylvanas)— Saurfang’s trust shatters. He won’t likely kill the
PC (unless they physically attack him), but he’ll make it clear they’re no true Horde to him. This drastically
alters the campaign for that PC: they become an enemy of Saurfang’s faction, perhaps even facing him in
battle if they stay Sylvanas-loyal to the end. In such a case, the PC might experience Saurfang’s
disappointment as a sort of “negative trust” arc – e.g. Saurfang might spare them at the Siege, saying
something like, “Go. Live with your choices. May they haunt you as mine have haunted me.” (Oof.) In short,
betraying Saurfang yields no rewards except a weight of shame the GM can compel often. On the flip side,
if the PC somehow saves Saurfang’s life during Mak’gora (which is off-script but possible in an RPG if
they intervened), then Saurfang lives but likely feels dishonored (that fight was meant to end him or
Sylvanas). He might admonish the PC for interfering in a sacred duel, ironically lowering trust because the
PC denied him an honorable death. The GM would have to resolve that carefully – maybe Saurfang goes
into exile or the PC’s relationship strains because they did what he specifically asked them not to (not to
interfere). It’s a poignant but complex outcome. 
Bonding Arc (Mentorship & Honor): Assuming the PC stays close to Saurfang, this arc emphasizes learning
and exemplifying Horde honor under his guidance, and Saurfang finding solace and hope in the PC’s
growth. Scenes might include:
Campfire Tales (Act II – Before the rebellion): While traveling or hiding out (like in the Swamp of
Sorrows en route to meet Thrall, or a night in Dustwallow on the way to gather allies), Saurfang and
the PC sit by a low fire. Zekhan might be snoring already, leaving just them. Saurfang, after long
silence, opens up with a story – perhaps reminiscing about his first battle or about Broxigar (his
brother) and what true courage meant. He might then unexpectedly ask the PC about their family or
past. This is a rare display of personal interest. If the PC shares (especially if they lost family or
struggled with honor themselves), Saurfang listens intently. He might give a single line of advice,
like: “Hold onto those memories. They give us strength when darkness surrounds us.” This quiet
mentorship strengthens their personal bond beyond soldiering. The PC may invoke a newfound
aspect “Saurfang’s Wisdom” in later willpower or empathy challenges as they recall this talk. 
Blademaster’s Lesson: Saurfang isn’t a flashy blademaster like some, but he can teach the PC one
of the old ways of orc combat – not just the physical technique, but the spiritual aspect (similar to a 
Mak’gora mindset). He might spar with the PC under the red sky of Orgrimmar’s outskirts before the
final battle. He shows them an opening stance to focus anger into precision (perhaps teaching the
PC a new stunt or giving them a free invoke “Steeled by Saurfang”). At one point, Saurfang feints and
thwacks the PC in a surprise move. “Expect the unexpected, always,” he says with a rare chuckle. If the
PC manages to strike him (unlikely, but maybe if they do something clever), he’ll actually laugh
hearty and say “Good! You fight with your head and heart.” This training is both practical and a
bonding moment (not many get to cross blades with him outside lethal combat).• 
• 
27

Ritual of Remembrance (Act IV – Pre-Siege): The night before the final showdown, Saurfang
gathers his small force in a solemn orc ritual to honor the fallen and bolster resolve. He carves
names (or symbols) of those they fight for on a piece of wood or stone: Dranosh, Vol’jin, names of
villages burned, etc. He invites the PC to add something – maybe the name of someone they lost or
even “Honor” itself as a concept. During this ritual, Saurfang chants an old orc dirge softly. When it’s
done, he quietly tells the PC: “No matter what happens tomorrow... know that your actions have upheld
the honor of our people.” This is effectively him giving the PC his moral blessing. Many NPCs might
not witness this, but it deeply affects the PC (and Saurfang). It’s like a surrogate father figure
acknowledging the PC’s worth. Mechanically, one could say the PC has a boost “Blessing of Varok” at
the siege battle – maybe allowing them to automatically resist a fear or mind control effect (because
their conviction is firm). Emotionally, it’s satisfying closure of their bond, especially since Saurfang
might die the next day.
Romance Arc: Not applicable – Saurfang is far too old and not written to have any romantic interest post
his mate’s death (Dranosh’s mother) long ago. The dynamic is mentorship, fatherly, comrade-in-arms. The
PC might come to love him as one loves an elder or hero, but not in a romantic way. (One could imagine a
female orc PC with a crush, but it’d be one-sided and Saurfang would gently ignore it or not realize it due to
his singular focus on honor and likely feeling too old for that sort of thing).
Rewards (Boon & Legacy): After Saurfang’s death (which is likely canon event), the PC and all rebels receive
intangible rewards – freedom, honor restored. Tangible possible rewards or honors for the PC specifically:
Shard of Saurfang’s Axe: When Sylvanas struck Saurfang, his mighty axe Shalamayne (actually
Anduin’s sword he borrowed, which broke, but let’s adjust: maybe he had his own axe that shattered)
split. The PC can be given a piece of it. This shard of black iron can be reforged into a dagger or
token. It carries the Aspect “ By Saurfang’s Blade.” Once per session, the PC can invoke this to either
automatically intimidate a minor foe (the legend of Saurfang’s weapon cowes them) or to inspire an
honor-bound ally to fight harder (“For Saurfang!” rallying cry granting a boost). Symbolically, it’s like
carrying a piece of his will. 
Title – “Hero of the Mak’gora” or “High Overlord’s Heir (Honorary)”: The new Horde council might
bestow a ceremonial title recognizing those who stood with Saurfang. The PC could be named an
honorary High Overlord of Orgrimmar’s forces until a formal one is chosen, or given the right to
wear a red and black mantle signifying they carry on Saurfang’s role. This title shows tremendous
respect – older grunts salute the PC, children in the Drag call them “Kor’kron hero” etc. It doesn’t
come with political power, but it’s cultural capital. Mechanically, leverage in social situations within
the Horde (basically, an invoke for +2 when dealing with Horde officials or troops who revere
Saurfang’s sacrifice). 
Companion Boon: Zekhan’s Loyalty: In a side effect, by gaining Saurfang’s trust, the PC almost
certainly befriended Zekhan (the young troll) as they were all in the rebellion camp together. Post-
war, Zekhan (now a rising figure, perhaps an ambassador/storyteller) might pledge himself to aid the
PC whenever needed, as they both were students of Saurfang. While not a “reward” in an item sense,
it means the GM can allow the PC to call on Zekhan in future adventures as an ally (maybe giving a
free aspect “Friend of Zappyboi” – comedic but useful, he could gather trolls for a cause or whatnot).
Integrating Saurfang’s guidance: The GM should use Saurfang as a moral compass NPC. He might compel
the PC’s aspects when appropriate (“Would Saurfang approve of what you’re about to do?”). If the PC heeds
those compels, Saurfang’s trust soars; if they don’t, conflict arises (maybe a scene where he scolds them).
This dynamic actively ties the PC’s choices to the trust arc.• 
• 
• 
• 
28

By the campaign’s end, if the PC earned Saurfang’s trust, their final memory of him could be him looking
over his shoulder at them before stepping out to Mak’gora, giving a subtle nod – a silent “Take care of the
Horde for me.” It’s a passing of the torch. The PC stands among Thrall, Jaina, and Anduin as Saurfang falls,
and hears his last words. In the aftermath, when the Horde and Alliance honor Saurfang, the PC is at the
front, perhaps even bearing Saurfang’s banner or leading the funeral rites (Baine or Thrall might insist the
PC light the pyre since they were so close to Varok in his final days). This cements the PC as one of the next
generation of Horde heroes that Saurfang believed in. There’s no greater reward for a Horde warrior’s
heart than that.
Grand Magister Rommath (Horde)
Psychological Profile: Grand Magister Rommath is the shrewd and proud leader of the Blood Elves’
magisters – a mage who guided Quel’Thalas through its darkest times. He studied under Prince
Kael’thas in Dalaran and followed him to Outland, later bringing back the teachings that allowed the Blood
Elves to survive (like siphoning magic from alternative sources). Thus, Rommath is cunning, pragmatic,
and a touch cynical. His motivation is to safeguard Silvermoon and the Sunwell’s purity, and to ensure
the Blood Elves remain strong and independent. He hopes to see Quel’Thalas restored to a glory even
greater than before the Scourge, and to avenge any who threaten it (the Scourge, the Burning Legion, and
now the Void). He fears a repeat of past disasters – the Sunwell being destroyed or corrupted again, or his
people falling under the sway of a false hope (like Kael’thas’s betrayal). He also has a personal fear of failure:
he carries guilt for having once served Kael’thas’s agenda (up until Kael went too far). This manifests as a
zero-tolerance stance toward anything that smells of treason or dangerous power (e.g. he was the one who
banished the Void elves exiles like Umbric, seeing them as a grave risk to the Sunwell). Personality-wise,
Rommath is stern, formal, and politically astute. He’s not as warm as Lor’themar or as openly passionate
as Lady Liadrin – Rommath is the calculating voice of caution in council. He often speaks in measured, sharp
phrases, and can be quite cutting or dismissive to those he finds foolish (he has a dry wit). To allies who
prove competent, he shows respect and even a hint of mentorship; to those he distrusts (like any who
dabble in Void or fel recklessly), he can be cold or outright hostile. In BfA, Rommath isn’t center stage,
but he features in the background of the Horde’s leadership. He likely supports Lor’themar in the rebellion
against Sylvanas once she imprisons Baine. (We can extrapolate: since Thalyssra and Lor’themar secretely
meet with Jaina to plan, Rommath probably coordinates magical logistics and keeps Silvermoon stable
during the rebellion.) He has a notable moment in patch 8.3: when Alleria visits Silvermoon, Rommath
strongly opposes allowing a Void user near the Sunwell, nearly causing a violent incident (that’s in the short
story “A Moment in Verse”/patch questline). That shows his intransigence on that issue. With a PC, building
trust means demonstrating magical aptitude or at least respect for magical boundaries, and loyalty to
Quel’Thalas and its regent. Rommath warms up to individuals who show scholarly inclination or tactical
sense, but he will test anyone who tries to get too familiar. If the PC is a Blood Elf, Rommath may treat them
as a junior he has to keep an eye on (especially if PC is a mage). If PC is not a Blood Elf, Rommath’s trust is
harder – one must prove they truly regard Blood Elf interests, not just wider Horde concerns. Once trusting,
Rommath can be an incredibly valuable ally: arcane knowledge, counsel, and even some protective
enchantments. He’s like the strict headmaster who, once you excel under him, gives you the keys to the
library. Emotional depth: Rommath doesn’t often display emotion besides tempered anger or satisfaction.
But mention of Kael’thas can stir bitterness and lingering hurt (Kael was friend and prince; his fall wounded
Rommath’s heart). Similarly, the Sunwell is near-sacred to him; he was present when it was reignited and
one of those responsible for keeping it safe. Any threat or risk to the Sunwell (like void corruption or
reckless experiments) makes him alarmed or furious beyond his normal stoicism. PCs will find he values28
33
34
29

discipline, loyalty, and discretion. Impress him with intelligent strategy or magical insight, and he’ll nod
approvingly; act rash or compromise the Sunwell’s security, and he’ll shut them down hard.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept – “Grand Magister of Quel’Thalas” (master mage, head of Blood Elf magical order,
carries authority and immense knowledge). Trouble – “Haunted by Past Betrayals” (Kael’thas’s treachery
and other betrayals make him distrustful; he’s hyper-vigilant and sometimes inflexible, can alienate
potential allies like the Void elves due to this). Other – “Sunwell’s Unyielding Guardian” (will do anything to
protect the Sunwell and by extension his people’s source of life), “Arcane Strategist” (brilliant planner using
magic in warfare, e.g. teleporting armies, countering spells; not just a caster but a general of magic). These
aspects cover his station, trust issues, priorities, and talents.
- Approaches: Clever +3, Careful +3, Flashy +2, Forceful +1, Quick +1, Sneaky +0. (Rommath is a thinking
man’s mage – very Clever in forming plans, traps, and deducing others’ magic. He’s equally Careful; he
double-checks wards, studies threats thoroughly (perhaps overly cautious at times). He can be Flashy in that
he’s capable of spectacular arcane displays when needed (commanding attention with a show of power),
but it’s not his default unless intimidation or flourish is required. Forceful – in direct confrontation, he
prefers precision over brute magical force, but he can muster force when pressed. Quick – his casting and
decision-making is more methodical than reactive, so average Quick. Sneaky – he doesn’t do subtle
subterfuge himself (though he might use illusions or others for secret tasks); he’s more direct in his
machinations.)
- Stunts: Arcane Countermeasure: If Rommath Cleverly creates an advantage by studying an enemy spell
or enchantment, he gets an extra free invoke on that advantage (i.e. he always finds an extra flaw or
counterspell opportunity). Example: scanning an enemy void shield – he finds not one but two weak points. Sunwell’s Fury: Once per scene, Rommath can call upon the Sunwell’s energy if near Quel’Thalas or if
he carries a stored mote of it. This allows him to Flashily attack with a surge of combined holy/arcane light,
giving +2 and the attack ignores any magical resistance (as the purity of Sunwell energy cuts through
corrupt magic). However, he uses this sparingly due to its precious nature. Teleportation Master: Rommath
can Carefully overcome obstacles via teleportation for himself or allies without rolling, once per session,
provided the destination is known and not warded. Essentially, trivial teleport uses are automatic (e.g., “We
need to get across this chasm” – he just opens a portal). If used in combat, he could reposition an ally or
himself to gain an advantage (narratively).
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 2, Mental 4. Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6). (Rommath
is not physically robust – he avoids physical confrontations and has wards to protect him ideally. Mentally,
he’s very strong-willed and trained against mind assaults or corruption. Years of shielding his mind and
making tough decisions grant him a high mental stress track. If anything, emotional turmoil regarding trust
could hit his mental track, but he’d bury it. He likely also has a special mild consequence slot for magical
burnout – e.g. “Mana Exhaustion” – reflecting if he overchannels arcane power. But that’s optional.)
Trust-Building Questline: To earn Rommath’s trust, a PC must demonstrate respect for Blood Elf
sovereignty, magical responsibility, and unwavering loyalty. It’s a more intellectual/political courtship
than, say, Saurfang’s brawn-based bond. Key milestones:
Diplomatic Decorum (Act I – War Council in Zulduzar): Suppose during the events prior to the
Battle of Dazar’alor, Lor’themar convenes a small war council including Rommath, perhaps Thalyssra,
etc., where the PC (Horde) is present as a champion. Rommath initially regards the PC with polite
distance. An opportunity arises: discuss strategy for containing the loa-infused magic in Zul’dazar or
countering Alliance’s Kirin Tor mages. If the PC offers a shrewd suggestion or some arcane33
35
1. 
30

insight, Rommath takes notice. For example, maybe the PC recalls a tidbit about how Jaina’s ship is
vulnerable to certain spells (like a magical wind could disperse her fog). Rommath raises an eyebrow
and says, “An astute observation... indeed, that could work.” He’ll credit the PC’s idea in execution. This
earns a sliver of trust; Rommath respects sharp minds and competence. Later, he might approach
the PC privately with a technical question or to clarify their idea (a sign he values their input). (If the
PC acted boorishly or had no thought beyond “hit them harder,” Rommath mentally writes them off
as just muscle. Trust starts at basically zero; he might even snark, “Thank you for your... contribution,”
in a tone implying there was none. The PC will need to recover by proving themselves in a more
hands-on magical scenario later.) 
The Void Crisis (Act II/III – Minor Sunwell Incident): While the war with the Alliance rages, there
could be a side scenario where void creatures (perhaps agents of Zul or Sylvanas’s allied San’layn
vampires messing with Blood Elf lands) threaten Quel’Thalas. Rommath handles it quickly, but
perhaps the PC is there to help. For instance, Alleria Windrunner tries a second time to visit the
Sunwell under truce to discuss alliance (this references an actual 8.3 quest where Alleria comes and
Rommath freaks out). If the PC is present and manages to keep the peace or assist Rommath in
protecting the Sunwell’s purity, trust leaps. Imagine: Alleria’s presence accidentally causes a void
manifestation near the Sunwell. Rommath is about to blast Alleria or demand her removal. The PC
diplomatically steps in – if they’re a Blood Elf, maybe they convince Rommath and Alleria to let the PC
siphon the void energy safely (taking on risk themselves). Or if PC is not skilled in that, they at
least help evacuate citizens and reinforce Rommath’s barrier spells. Success: The void rift is
contained with PC’s aid, and the Sunwell stabilizes. Rommath, breathing heavily from exertion, looks
at the PC with genuine respect for the first time. “You kept a level head in a crisis that could have
damned us all. The Grand Magister is... in your debt,” he admits, perhaps bowing his head slightly – an
enormous gesture from someone as proud as Rommath. He then pointedly tells Lor’themar of the
PC’s actions, securing formal praise. From now on, Rommath trusts the PC with sensitive tasks (e.g.,
he might ask them to take a message or artifact to safeguard, a sign of trust). (If the PC had fumbled
– say they made things worse by aggravating Alleria or panicking – Rommath’s distrust hardens. He
might even blame the PC: “Fool! You nearly exposed the Sunwell!” It would take much to recover from
that, maybe another scenario where PC redeems themselves by some grand gesture for Quel’Thalas.
Best avoid that route if building trust.) 
Arcane Alliance (Act IV – Helping Enable the Rebel Communication): Prior to the final
confrontation, there’s covert coordination between the Horde rebels and Alliance. In lore, Thalyssra
and Jaina meet via portal arranged by First Arcanist and probably Rommath. The PC, if trusted by
Rommath, could be involved in these subterfuges. Milestone: Rommath needs a discreet operative
to manage a relay or magical focus for a secret meeting – he taps the PC. “Do not disappoint me. This
requires precision and silence,” he says. The PC then has to e.g. plant mana crystals at certain ley line
junctures around Orgrimmar to create a hidden portal for Baine’s rescuers or to allow
communication between Lor’themar and Anduin. If the PC executes this subtly and effectively,
Rommath is impressed. Perhaps one segment nearly goes awry (Alliance scouts almost stumble on a
crystal) but the PC uses cunning to divert them, protecting the plan. Afterward, Rommath perhaps
even smiles faintly at the PC: “Flawless work. I knew I saw potential in you.” He then shares a bit of
personal perspective – maybe he remarks the PC’s cleverness reminds him of “youth in fairer days” (a
veiled reference to studying with Kael’thas and how hope for the future lies in young blood). This is
almost affectionate in Rommath’s own way. Trust fills up here – Rommath will advocate for the PC’s
interests in councils and would consider them a friend (as much as he has friends). (Alternate failure:
if the PC bungled the stealth and nearly blew the cover of the rebel comms, Rommath will be icy. He
might salvage it, but later tell the PC to stick to frontline fighting – effectively cutting them out of
delicate matters. The PC would have to do something exceptional in the final battle magically to2.

regain his trust, like saving a bunch of Blood Elf rangers with a clever spell or personally shielding
the Sunwell from an attack, etc.)
With Trust maxed, Rommath treats the PC as a confidant and valuable asset of Quel’Thalas. Reward:
Aspect – “Esteemed by the Magisters”: The PC gains this reflecting that the highest elf sorcerers
regard them well. They can invoke it for +2 when dealing with Blood Elf institutions (want access to a
forbidden library? They drop Rommath’s name or letter and doors open) or when attempting
complex magical research (the Magisters’ network shares knowledge with them). Essentially, they
become an honorary Magister. Rommath might even present them with ceremonial red robes lined
with gold – not saying they outrank actual magisters, but marking them a friend of the order. 
Stunt – “Phoenix’s Rebirth” (Magical Boon): As a mark of favor, Rommath teaches the PC an
advanced spell or grants them an enchantment from Quel’Thalas’s archives. For instance, a one-time
resurrection spell (Fate terms: once per scenario, if the PC is taken out due to physical stress, they
instead are reduced to 1 stress and the stunt is “used up” for that session – described as a phoenix-
down type flame that Rommath imbued them with ). Or an Arcanist’s Insight: once per session,
they may ask the GM, “What is the hidden weakness or function of this magical phenomenon?” and
get a truthful answer (a reflection of Rommath’s ongoing mentorship).
Unique Item – “Spellbound Crystal”: Rommath gifts a crystal from the Sunwell’s periphery, attuned
to the PC. It has an Aspect “Sunwell Resonance”. The PC can invoke this crystal to greatly amplify
one spell (perhaps a +3 instead of +2 once, or to achieve an effect normally beyond them), or to ward
off a shadow attack completely once (the crystal shatters afterwards). If the PC isn’t a caster, it might
instead bolster their weapon with arcane energy (giving a one-time super strike). It’s a potent,
limited-use boon. Rommath warns: “Use it only at the direst need.” Even possessing it is a sign of his
trust (he wouldn’t allow many to carry a Sunwell-charged crystal). 
Title – “Friend of Silvermoon”: Not an official government title, but Lor’themar and Rommath
publicly thank the PC after the war for their service to the Blood Elves. The PC’s name is entered in
the Scrolls of Silvermoon (a historical record of allies). In practice, any Blood Elf citizen or Farstrider
will treat the PC with hospitality. The PC might walk through the gates of Silvermoon and have actual
fanfare. Thalyssra jokes that the PC is practically a “honorary sin’dorei”. Game-wise, any Persuasion or
Leadership rolls in Blood Elf territory drop in difficulty, and minor favors (like requisitioning
Farstrider scouts or getting an audience with Lor’themar) are granted readily. 
Integration & Notes: Rommath is not as emotionally high-stakes an NPC as Saurfang or Jaina, but his arc
adds depth to the PC’s involvement in the more subtle side of Horde politics and magic. The GM can use
Rommath as the voice of caution or to present morally gray decisions (e.g., he might propose using a
forbidden spell to end a battle quickly – does the PC agree or push back? Either can affect his trust:
agreeing shows pragmatism which he likes, but pushing back with good reason shows independent
judgment, which if argued well, he might respect even more). 
It’s key to show Rommath’s character growth too: through trusting the PC, he may learn to trust more in
the new generation and even soften slightly on his rigid stance. For example, maybe by the end, he’s willing
to tolerate the Void elf Alleria at a peace gathering because the PC vouches (“If $PCName$ believes it safe, I
will restrain my suspicions – for now.”). That illustrates the PC influenced him positively.
By the epilogue, if all went well, Rommath invites the PC to Silvermoon for a private celebration. In his study
atop one of Silvermoon’s spires, he pours two glasses of arcwine (from Suramar, courtesy of Thalyssra’s
trade). He toasts: “To a future where the sacrifices of our people are never forgotten – and to those willing to• 
•

•

• 
32

prevent history’s mistakes. Here’s to you, $PCName$.” It’s probably the most heartfelt thing he’ll say. The PC has
not only gained an ally but helped heal a bit of Rommath’s guarded heart, ensuring Quel’Thalas’s
knowledge and pride stand strong in the Horde moving forward.
Ranger-General Halduron Brightwing (Horde)
Psychological Profile: Ranger-General Halduron Brightwing is the calm and pragmatic commander of
Silvermoon’s Farstriders. As Sylvanas’s successor in that role, he carries the legacy of the high elven
rangers, leading Quel’Thalas’s defenses and ranged forces. Halduron is steady, brave, and markedly more
open-minded than some of his counterparts. He fought through the Scourge invasion, the Ghostlands
campaign, and many Horde Alliance conflicts with distinction. His motivation is to protect Quel’Thalas and
ensure the unity and survival of his people. He hopes for a future where the blood elves can live without
constant war and perhaps reconcile with their estranged kin (he’s known to be more friendly to Alliance/
allied high elves than most; e.g., he worked cooperatively with Vereesa’s rangers against the Amani trolls in
the past). He fears failure in duty – like another invasion catching them unprepared, or the Farstriders
losing their honor. He also has a subtle fear of Sylvanas’s fate; Sylvanas was once his colleague and friend,
and seeing her fall into darkness troubles him deeply (but he seldom voices this beyond a sad comment).
Personality: Halduron is approachable, somewhat wry, and loyal. Among the Sin’dorei leadership, he’s the
least formal – he speaks like a ranger in the field, even in council halls, often offering a grounded
perspective. He has a dry sense of humor; for example, when Lor’themar gets too tense, Halduron might
quip something about “rather being in the woods with an angry murloc than in another meeting.” He’s also
compassionate – he argued for helping the Alliance at Wrathgate, and in the "Three Sisters" comic, he
facilitated Alleria and Vereesa’s secret visit to Sylvanas’s monument despite potential political backlash.
These show he values family and doing what's right over strict politics at times. However, he’s also a
disciplined soldier; in war he’s focused and deadly, coordinating ranger strikes and personally being an
excellent archer. A PC interacting with Halduron will find him fair and friendly if they show integrity and
respect (especially respect for the Farstriders or the land). If the PC is a fellow ranger or hunter-type,
Halduron immediately treats them like one of his own, possibly swapping tips or friendly rivalry. If the PC is
not, he’ll still be polite – he’s not haughty like some belves can be. But one must prove they understand
ranger values: cunning, respect for nature, teamwork, and honor in hunting (no needless cruelty).
Halduron’s triggers: Amani trolls – they killed many of his comrades, he’s fierce against them; Sylvanas’s
memory – he defends her past heroism even as he condemns her present, which can be a delicate topic;
Farstrider casualties – if his rangers die avoidably, he takes it personally. Building trust with him likely
involves fighting alongside him in skirmishes, demonstrating camaraderie and competence, and
maybe helping bridge understanding between factions (like with night elves or Alliance, which Halduron
is open to if it helps greater good). He’s also a mentor figure to younger rangers (like he was to the
Farstrider trainees). So a PC could become sort of his favored protege if they impress him. Emotions:
Halduron tends to be outwardly calm under pressure – in battle, cool and focused – but with friends at ease,
he can be warm and even playful (imagine him telling a lighthearted tale at a campfire about a time
Sylvanas got pranked, etc.). He has a warrior’s heart but an elf’s patience.
Fate Core Stat Sheet:
- Aspects: High Concept – “Ranger-General of Silvermoon” (master archer, strategic leader of all Farstriders,
protector of Quel’Thalas’s borders). Trouble – “Duty Above All, Even Politics” (he puts protecting his land
and kin first, which can put him at odds with political directives; e.g., he might break rank to do what’s right,
risking censure). Other – “Steady Hand, Steadfast Heart” (unflappable in crisis, a source of morale for others),39
39
33

“Bridger of Two Eras” (he knew the high elf ways and now leads in the blood elf era; he tries to honor
tradition while embracing new Horde alliances – making him relatively diplomatic). These capture his
leadership, potential conflicts between duty and orders, composure, and bridging old/new.
- Approaches: Careful +3, Quick +3, Clever +2, Flashy +1, Forceful +1, Sneaky +2. (As a ranger, Halduron is
both careful – planning ambushes, patiently tracking targets – and quick – an agile combatant and fast
reaction shot. He’s Sneaky when needed for stealth missions or laying traps (typical ranger skills). Clever –
he’s tactically smart but maybe not an arcane scholar or schemer at court, so moderate. Flashy – he doesn’t
show off; he’s modest, except perhaps to inspire troops or when making a dramatic well-placed arrow shot,
but that’s more effective than showy. Forceful – in melee he’s capable but not his forte; he prefers finesse to
brute strength.)
- Stunts: Master Marksman: Halduron gets +2 to Carefully attack a target at long range if he has observed
them for at least one exchange (i.e., give him a moment to line up the shot). He famously never misses
when he takes his time. Farstrider’s Tactics: Once per scene, Halduron can create an advantage “Enfilading
Fire” or “Pinning Volley” for his allies with a Quick volley of arrows. Essentially, he can provide covering fire
that grants a free invoke for an ally’s action (e.g., enemy forced to duck, giving ally opening). Eyes of the
Ranger-General: Halduron’s scouting skills allow him to Carefully overcome obstacles related to detecting
threats or finding paths with ease. If there’s an ambush or hidden foe, he can declare he anticipated it and
maybe negate the surprise (GM might allow a one-time ignore of an ambush aspect or trap, explaining
Halduron spotted telltales ahead of time).
- Stress & Consequences: Physical 3, Mental 3. Consequences: Mild (2), Moderate (4), Severe (6). (He’s fit
and resilient as any frontline veteran, though not a hulking brute. Mentally he’s strong-willed and calm, but
seeing comrades die or an innocent harmed on his watch can break through his stoicism – perhaps why his
mental track isn’t higher, as emotional hits can hurt him deeply. Still, he doesn’t have special extra slots; he’s
balanced.)
Trust-Building Questline: To gain Halduron’s trust, a PC should demonstrate courage in battle, respect
for his people’s values, and maybe an effort to foster unity in times of division. Key milestones:
Jungle Allies (Act I – Zandalar Campaign, Nazmir excursion): Suppose the Horde sends a
Farstrider squad under Halduron to Nazmir to assist the Zandalari against Blood Trolls while main
forces focus elsewhere. The PC is part of this. During an encounter with blood trolls and their
undead beasts in the swamps, things get dicey: perhaps a trap pins some Farstriders. If the PC
takes initiative to save Halduron’s rangers – like covering their retreat, slaying a dire troll about to
smash a wounded elf – Halduron notes it. After the skirmish, while cleaning troll ichor off his bow,
Halduron claps the PC’s shoulder: “Your swift action saved lives. You fight as one of us, $PCName$.”
That’s significant praise; essentially an invitation into the Farstrider brotherhood. Trust begins. (If the
PC was reckless or ignored a comrade’s plight to chase more kills, Halduron would frown. He values
teamwork; the PC might get a mild reprimand: “We don’t leave our own behind.” They’ll need to
improve to earn his confidence.) 
Honor at the Reunion (Act II – “Three Sisters” scenario adaptation): Let’s bring the “Three Sisters”
comic event in play: Alleria and Vereesa secretly visit Windrunner Spire in Ghostlands, Sylvanas
shows up; tense encounter. In lore, Halduron allowed the meeting and helped diffuse it. The PC
could be present or just outside in case of trouble (perhaps Lor’themar asked them to accompany
Halduron quietly). If the PC aids Halduron in managing this delicate situation – e.g., when
Sylvanas nearly attacks Vereesa, the PC subtly moves to guard Vereesa or talk down Sylvanas with an
appeal to family – that impresses Halduron greatly. It’s a complex scenario requiring restraint and
empathy. Halduron later tells the PC: “Few could stand in that storm with calm. You have my respect.”1. 
2. 
34

Particularly if the PC is not an elf, their willingness to protect even Alliance Windrunners at risk of
angering Sylvanas shows principle over faction, which Halduron values. (Alternate: if the PC wasn’t
involved in that specifically, another scenario: PC helps Halduron negotiate with an Alliance ranger
unit in Arathi during the warfront ceasefire to recover fallen bodies. Show of mutual respect.
Ensuring an honorable outcome – like returning dead to families rather than desecration – would
earn trust similarly.) By now, Halduron perhaps invites the PC to train with his rangers or share in a
Farstrider meal (sign of acceptance). 
Sharpshooters at Orgrimmar (Act IV – Siege of Orgrimmar): During the final battle against
Sylvanas’s loyalists, Halduron and his Farstriders take positions on the rooftops of Orgrimmar to
cover Saurfang’s advance. The PC is tasked with a critical shot or action alongside Halduron. For
instance, an enemy demolisher on a far ridge is raining havoc; Halduron lines up a long-distance
arrow but needs a second shooter to hit simultaneously at two weak points (a very tricky dual-shot). 
If the PC coordinates with Halduron for a perfect dual strike, destroying the siege weapon in one
go, Halduron grins mid-battle: “Bullseye! Couldn’t have done better myself.” This mutual triumph under
fire cements trust fully – they have literally had each other’s back and succeeded. After the battle, as
the dust settles and Sylvanas flees, Halduron personally thanks the PC in the victory gathering.
Perhaps he announces to others that the PC is as true a Farstrider as any elf – effectively endorsing
them. (If the PC failed that key moment – say they missed the shot and an ally died because of it –
Halduron wouldn’t scorn them if it was an honest try, but he’d be deeply disappointed and saddened.
Trust might stagnate; he might attribute it to misfortune, but the PC would feel they let him down.
They could partially redeem by bravery elsewhere, but that shining “buddy” moment would be lost.
Ideally, script for success to satisfy arc.)
When Trust is filled, Halduron treats the PC like a trusted comrade and friend. He will gladly fight
alongside them anytime and even speak on their behalf to Lor’themar or other leaders. Reward:
Aspect – “Farstrider Proven”: The PC gains this aspect signifying they are an honorary Farstrider.
They can invoke it for +2 on actions related to wilderness travel, archery, or ambush tactics when
operating with Farstriders or using their training. Also can be invoked in social contexts among
Horde (and even Alliance ranger types) as a badge of respect (“They fought with Halduron at
Orgrimmar” carries weight). 
Unique Gear – A Farstrider Longbow or Cloak: Halduron gifts the PC a personal item – perhaps a
beautifully crafted elven longbow he had spare (or the PC’s bow if they have one, he has it enhanced
by Silvermoon’s smiths). It could have an Aspect “Aimed True” which can be invoked once per session
to either hit a nearly impossible target or ignore cover/distraction penalties. If the PC isn’t a ranged
fighter, then likely a Farstrider cloak – camouflage green with enchanted thread – that gives +2 to
Sneaky in natural environments when invoked (basically a cloak of elvenkind flavor). 
Stunt – “Ranger-General’s Guidance”: Through training with Halduron, the PC learns a thing or
two. One possible stunt: Once per conflict, if an ally misses on a ranged attack, the PC can immediately
make a Quick reaction shot to turn that miss into a hit. (Narrative: the ally misses, but the PC follows the
arrow and corrects by hitting the target anyway – a trick Halduron taught them about reading
others’ shots.) Alternatively, a non-combat stunt: Because Halduron taught you the ways of the wild, you
gain +2 to overcome obstacles in forest/jungle terrain.
Title – “Champion of Eversong”: Lor’themar (on Halduron’s recommendation) bestows a ceremonial
title to the PC during a post-war honors ceremony. The PC is named a “Champion of Eversong
Woods,” protector of Quel’Thalas. There might even be a small inscription of their name in the
Farstrider Lodge’s hall of heroes. This title has no direct mechanical effect but narrative significance:3. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
35

any Blood Elf in Eversong recognizes it. A bench of Farstriders salutes the PC when they pass. It’s
rare for a non-Blood Elf to have such a title, underlining the exceptional trust. 
Personal: Halduron invites the PC to join him on an annual Farstrider hunt in Eversong (like a
friendly gathering to cull any lingering Amani scouts or magical beasts encroaching). That’s not loot,
but it’s a sign of lifelong friendship – a standing invitation like “anytime you wish to walk our woods
with me, you are welcome.” If the PC is Blood Elf, that’s like being fully embraced in the top circles of
their society. If not, it still shows cross-cultural bond.
Mentorship & Bonding Scenes:
After war, a quieter bonding: Halduron and PC might visit Sylvanas’s monument in Windrunner
Spire together to reflect. Halduron perhaps says a few words for Sylvanas (despite all, remembering
who she was). He might open up: “She taught me much. We must remember even the brightest can cast
dark shadows.” The PC being there in that vulnerable moment (maybe placing flowers or just
listening) deepens their camaraderie beyond battle.
Halduron could also appear in future story hooks for the PC: if PC ever needs help (say in a later
campaign in a dense forest or if they’re dealing with an Amani resurgence), they can call on
Halduron. The GM can literally have Halduron show up with a squad at a crucial time (“The hawk you
sent reached us. The Farstriders stand with you.”).
Conversely, if PC is in Alliance group and befriended Halduron, perhaps in a future uneasy truce
scenario, Halduron might vouch for them (“This one saved my life in Nazmir; I trust them.”).
Alliance note: It’s possible an Alliance PC (like a Night Elf) could earn Halduron’s respect (maybe they
cooperated against the Amani or during the Undercity battle they saved each other). In that case,
Halduron’s trust yields a unique cross-faction friendship. He might correspond via letters with the PC
afterward, exchanging info about scourge movements or sharing ranger techniques (like an intel ally in
Horde territory). If an Alliance PC goes Void Elf route (like Alleria’s student), Halduron might be cautious but
could come around due to trust in the individual.
By the story’s end, the PC being in Halduron’s good graces means a shining example of how the Horde’s
new generation can form bonds of trust and friendship beyond old boundaries – exactly what the Horde will
need to heal. Halduron likely raises a toast to the PC at a victory feast in Sunfury Spire, perhaps joking: “If
you ever tire of your current post, there’s a place for you among the Farstriders.” Whether jest or sincere (it’s
sincere), it encapsulates the journey from strangers to true comrades.
GM Note on Seamless Integration: These NPC questlines are woven into Act progression of the BFA
campaign, not presented in isolation. Each trust milestone corresponds to major events (War of Thorns,
Siege of Lordaeron, War Campaign strides, The rebellion and final battle). They should be portrayed during
regular sessions – e.g. when describing a battle, include how an NPC reacts and how the PC can gain their
trust through choices in that scene. The branching outcomes (loyalty vs betrayal) should organically follow
from player decisions, with the consequences (like Saurfang’s scorn or Rommath shutting them out)
logically affecting the unfolding story. The goal is that players feel these relationships evolving alongside
the main plot, enriching the narrative stakes (it’s not just the fate of Azeroth, but also the fate of mentors,
friendships, even romances they care about).
By the end of the campaign, the addition of Nathanos, Turalyon, Arator, Taelia, Saurfang, Rommath, and
Halduron as fully realized NPC companions means the world feels alive and interconnected. These• 
• 
•

36

characters’ personal growth arcs (Nathanos questioning blind loyalty, Turalyon balancing Light with
humanity, Arator coming into his own, Taelia discovering her heritage, Saurfang redeeming the Horde’s
honor, Rommath learning trust, Halduron fostering unity) all parallel and enhance the main BFA storyline.
They provide the players with meaningful choices (betray or stand by, romance or friendship, mentor or
peer) and diverse resolution paths (as requested, betrayal vs loyalty, love vs camaraderie, etc.), making the
outcome of the campaign uniquely theirs based on how these relationships pan out.
Finally, each NPC companion’s presence adds emotional weight to the Acts: Act I’s tragedies sting more if
trusted NPCs are affected, Act II’s intrigue deepens with their counsel, Act III’s climax is more triumphant or
tragic depending on who stands with the PCs, and the epilogue becomes a tapestry of farewells and new
beginnings among these friends. In essence, by integrating these NPC arcs, the Battle for Azeroth
becomes not just a war, but a personal saga of trust, honor, and connection across faction lines and amidst
world-changing events.
