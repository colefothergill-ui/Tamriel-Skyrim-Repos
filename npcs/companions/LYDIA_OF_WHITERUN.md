# Lydia of Whiterun – Housecarl on a New Quest.

Lydia of Whiterun – Housecarl on a New Quest.
High Concept: Devoted Housecarl Without a Thane (Nord warrior assigned as housecarl to the Dragonborn,
now languishing without a master after Dragonborn vanished).
Trouble: “I Am Sworn to Carry Your Burdens” (a hint of resentment or at least fatigue – she’s dutiful but longs
for respect and purpose beyond being a pack mule).
Aspect: Skyrim’s Honor, Nord’s Heart (believes in honor, will protect the innocent staunchly, and has a strong
Nord identity – proud, somewhat traditional).
Aspect: Blade and Board (renowned for her sword-&-shield fighting style; tactically, she’s excellent at holding
a line or defending allies).
Skills: Good Fight (Sword & Shield specialist), Good Physique (sturdy and can carry gear, true to meme),
Fair Intimidation (has a stern, imposing presence), Fair Empathy (surprisingly observant of her Thane’s
moods, etc.). Average Survival (from traveling as thane’s escort).
Stunts: “Protective Stance” – When an ally in the same zone is attacked, Lydia can choose to become the
target instead (1× per scene) and gets +2 to defend on that intercepted attack. “Housecarl’s Vow” – Once
per session, if her bonded PC (Thane) is in peril, she gains +2 to any one overcome or attack directly aiding
that PC. (E.g. bursting through rubble to reach them, striking an enemy from behind who has them
grappled, etc.)
Stress: 3 physical, 2 mental. Armor: She typically wears steel armor (Armor: 1 against physical harm).
Recruitment: By lore, Lydia becomes housecarl to the Dragonborn after they’re made Thane of Whiterun. In this timeline, after the Dragonborn disappeared to Solstheim, Lydia has been effectively unused –
possibly guarding Breezehome or aiding Irileth with city defense. The PC party can recruit her in a few ways.
If any PC earned the title Thane of Whiterun (maybe by slaying a dragon or performing service for Jarl
Balgruuf in Act I), Balgruuf can assign Lydia to them. She will then follow that PC’s orders as dutiful
housecarl. If the PCs are not Thanes, they might appeal to Jarl Balgruuf or Vignar (depending who controls
Whiterun) to “borrow” Lydia’s assistance for a critical mission – citing her experience and the lack of her
original master. Lydia herself, eager to be useful, might volunteer if the PCs impress her (perhaps they save
Whiterun from something, or she witnesses them defending civilians). She’s unlikely to go with open
Stormcloaks before Whiterun joins them – she’s loyal to Balgruuf. But after Whiterun’s taken (if Stormcloaks
control it), she might become disillusioned or free to choose her path, at which point a respectful PC
(particularly a Nord PC who treats her as an equal) can gain her loyalty.
Romance: Optional. Lydia is a marriage candidate in Skyrim, implying interest in a partner who is strong
and honorable. A PC who consistently respects her (never treating her as a mere servant) and fights
valiantly will earn her admiration. She’s reserved romantically, but a quiet moment perhaps after a near-
death battle could spark something (“I’m just glad you’re safe, my Thane… ahem”). If romanced, she might
struggle between duty and feeling – e.g., if ordered into a suicidal situation by her love, she’ll go but a tear
in her eye. It could provide a dramatic beat: a villain exploiting this (e.g. threatening the Thane to force
Lydia’s surrender). Mechanically, a romance could allow a once-per session boost: if her beloved is in mortal
danger, Lydia gets +2 to any one action to save them (beyond her usual stunt) – love’s adrenaline.
Conversely, if her beloved falls in battle, the GM might compel her Trouble to send her into a reckless frenzy
or deep despair.
Personal Quest Hook: “Burden of Legacy” – Lydia mentions she is from a minor noble family fallen on hard
times (this is speculative but fits her being Housecarl material). She has an old heirloom blade from her
father, broken during the Great War. If reforged, it could become a symbol of her own worthiness beyond
serving others. The PCs could seek out a master smith (perhaps Alvor or Eorlund Gray-Mane) to fix it. Doing
so gives Lydia a newfound confidence (replace her Trouble with something like “Proud of My Own Name”). It
also could give her a weapon stunt tied to that blade (maybe +2 vs Thalmor, since it might be Akaviri make
or similar). Another arc: “The Missing Thane” – Lydia still technically serves the absent Dragonborn. She may
ask the PCs for help finding out what happened to them (did they truly go to Solstheim? Are they alive?).

While the campaign’s focus isn’t on that DLC, the GM can give some closure: a letter arrives via courier from
the Dragonborn (perhaps they’re off fighting Miraak or sailed away). Lydia reading a letter from her original
Thane releasing her from service would be emotional; it frees her to fully commit to the PC group. She
might hold a small ceremony burning an old possession of the Dragonborn as a farewell, swearing her
sword now to the PC cause with no reservations. The result: she gains an aspect “Free Woman of Skyrim”
which might be invoked when her independent judgment or initiative matters (no longer waiting for orders
hesitantly, she’ll proactively act).
Usage: Lydia is balanced in offense and defense, making her a reliable front-liner in fights alongside PCs.
She can take hits (and often will via her stunts) that might drop squishier PCs. In roleplay, she might offer
pragmatic advice, albeit sometimes with dry humor or open skepticism if a plan sounds dumb – “As you say,
my Thane… but are you sure charging alone is wise?” She addresses the PC she’s assigned to as “Thane” by
default 41 – consider that an aspect reflecting her formal demeanor. Over time, that could soften, showing
character growth (she might finally call the PC by name in a crucial heartfelt moment). Also, lean into the
comedic side lightly (carrying burdens) but don’t reduce her to that – she’s brave and competent. If a PC
does abuse her as a pack mule too much, maybe have her express a bit of that sass: “I am sworn to carry
your burdens… and perhaps an extra blade or two, but not the entire loot of this cavern!” reminding them
she’s a person. This usually endears her more to players.
