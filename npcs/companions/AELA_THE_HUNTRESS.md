# Aela the Huntress – Werewolf Archer of the Companions.

Aela the Huntress – Werewolf Archer of the Companions.
High Concept: Elite Companion & Werewolf Tracker (Nord member of the Companions’ Circle, a consummate
hunter blessed/cursed with lycanthropy).
Trouble: Blood of the Beast (as a werewolf, Aela struggles with the beast’s aggression; also, Silver weapons
or the mention of a cure trigger her pride – she doesn’t see lycanthropy as a curse).
Aspect: “One of The Circle” (respected leader within the Companions; her word carries weight in Jorrvaskr,
and she holds Kodlak’s values dear except she’s reluctant to cure herself).
Aspect: Nightingale Eyes, Predator’s Grace (Aela is an expert archer and scout; she moves with quiet
confidence and can read tracks like a book).
Skills: Excellent Shoot (bow sniper), Good Stealth, Good Athletics, Fair Fight (daggers in close), Fair Lore
(Wildlife). In werewolf form, her Physique and Fight dramatically increase (we can treat that as a situational
boost or alternate stat block).
Stunts: “Moonborn Frenzy” – Once per scenario, Aela can transform into her werewolf form (if not cured)
which gives her +2 to Physique rolls and +2 to create advantage with fearsome presence (foes might get
aspect “Shaken by Werewolf”). Drawback: she may need to roll Will to avoid attacking indiscriminately.
“Hunter’s Mark” – If Aela has time to study a foe or its tracks, she gains +2 on one attack or overcome
against that target (her knowledge of prey’s weak points). Additionally, “Wolfpack Tactics” – when fighting
alongside another werewolf or Companion, she gets +1 to Fight due to pack coordination (this could apply if
a PC is a werewolf or if Farkas/Vilkas present, etc.).
Stress: 3 physical, 2 mental. Special: As a werewolf, she ignores moderate physical consequences until after
a fight (too adrenaline-fueled to feel wounds), though they must be accounted for after.
Recruitment: If the PCs complete part of the Companions quest (in Side Plot C) – for instance, helping cure
Kodlak or avenging Skjor’s death – Aela will readily join them on certain missions. She isn’t a follower in
the game until after those quests, similar logic here. So likely, Act II or III, after “Silver Hand” events, she can
become a companion. Alternatively, if no PC did the Companions storyline, Aela could be met during a
Dragonbreak creature event (say they fight a common enemy like a Silver Hand remnant or a giant) and earn
mutual respect. She won’t suffer fools or the meek; PCs need to demonstrate prowess or honor to interest
her. She’s not going to follow an Imperial outright unless that PC also has ties to Companions or a very
convincing reason (like, “We’re hunting the same prey, join us”). If a PC is a werewolf (through Companions
18
quest), that nearly guarantees her alliance – she sees them as pack. If the PC chose to cure the Companions,
note: Aela refused the cure in lore. That could cause friction or a chance for roleplay (she might join to
keep the old ways alive, maybe intent on finding a new tribe of werewolves).
Romance: Possible. Aela is fiercely independent and respects strength above all. A PC who proves a greater
or equal hunter could stir her interest. She’s one of the more popular romance options in Skyrim for her
confidence. In roleplay, an Aela romance might involve competitive banter (“You call that a shot? Watch my
arrow.”) that turns into mutual admiration. If the PC is also a werewolf, that shared bond is very intimate for
her (“Run with me under the moon?” could be a significant moment). She wouldn’t be overly affectionate
publicly, but in private might share tribal tattoos meaning or personal stories (like how she heard Hircine’s
call first time). Mechanically, if romanced, they might fight exceptionally well together – e.g., once per
session if fighting back to back with her lover, they each get +1 to attacks (syncing movements).
Personal Quest Hook: “Totems of Hircine” – After the main Companions quest, Aela often seeks the Totems
of Hircine (artifacts to enhance werewolf abilities). In this campaign, perhaps she asks the PCs to help
retrieve one from a dangerous dungeon (could be tied to a Dragonbreak creature like a spriggan grove or
vampire den). Outcome options: if they get a Totem, Aela can gain a new stunt (like “Scent of Prey – can
sense living creatures nearby”) and she’s deeply grateful, cementing her loyalty. If a PC is a werewolf, they
benefit too (maybe an extra invoke on transformation related rolls). Conversely, if the PCs gently steer her
toward Kodlak’s philosophy of finding a cure for her soul, you could run a quest where she encounters
Kodlak’s spirit in Ysgramor’s Tomb (if Kodlak’s been cured in the afterlife) – this might soften her stance.
Notably, Aela is the only Circle member who never wanted a cure 7 ; a poignant story could be her
wrestling with that: does she remain a beast or let go for Sovngarde? The PCs’ influence and the outcomes
of other werewolf events (like wiping out Silver Hand, avenging Skjor) will factor in. Perhaps by campaign
end she remains werewolf, or maybe she chooses to take the cure (especially if a romanced PC asks her to
grow old with them). This could change her Trouble aspect accordingly.
Usage: Aela brings a stealth/sniper element to the party. She can scout ahead and report (use her high
Stealth and Notice to feed aspects to PCs like “Enemy Positions Marked”). In open fights, she takes high
ground and thins out enemy numbers with arrows. If enemies close in melee, she either falls back in wolf-
quick retreats or, if enraged, shifts to werewolf and leaps in. She’s also a source of lore on Hircine,
lycanthropy, and Nordic hunting traditions 43 , which can enrich scenes (she might tell a tale around the fire
of old hunts or caution against certain creatures that even Companions fear). She has little patience for
court politics but a strong sense of honor – if PCs plan to do something sneaky that is dishonorable, she’ll
voice disapproval (which can be a nice in-character way to remind players of potential reputation loss). If the
campaign involves the Stormcloak/Imperial divide: Aela doesn’t overtly involve herself in that conflict
(Companions are neutral), but she cares about Nordic heritage – she might lean Stormcloak in private, but
Kodlak’s influence keeps her from outright saying it. GMs can use her as a neutral perspective on the war: “Skyrim’s problems won’t vanish with one side’s victory. The real threats stalk in the woods while you lot
bicker.” It helps refocus players on bigger picture when needed.
