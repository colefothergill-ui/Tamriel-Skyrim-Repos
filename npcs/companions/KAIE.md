# Kaie – Forsworn Insider and Swiftblade.

Kaie – Forsworn Insider and Swiftblade.
High Concept: Forsworn Guerrilla Liaison (Breton Reachwoman who fought under Madanach, skilled in dual-
wielding and stealth, can guide the party through Reach politics).
Trouble: Branded a Traitor by All Sides (To Nords, she’s a Forsworn terrorist; to some Forsworn hardliners,
she’s too moderate or too cooperative with “outlanders.” Trust is a constant issue).
Aspect: Old Gods’ Devotee (she follows Forsworn druidic customs – may perform small rituals, has
knowledge of Reach magic lore and maybe a minor hedge magic ability, e.g. brewing poisons or salves).
Aspect: Personal Debt to <PC/Faction> (If the PCs freed Madanach with her help, or spared innocents in
Markarth, etc., she feels indebted. If they treated the Reachfolk fairly, she’s fiercely loyal to them over
her own tribe’s skepticism).
Skills: Great Fight (Daggers and quick strikes – her moniker “Swiftblade of the Reach” is well-earned 49 ),
Good Stealth, Good Survival (knows the caves and wilderness of the Reach intimately), Fair Lore (Reach
myths), Fair Empathy (used to reading foes’ and friends’ intent – a necessity living among potential
betrayal).
Stunts: “Red Eagle’s Fury, Madanach’s Guile” – +2 to Create Advantage when ambushing or using the
environment cleverly in the Reach (e.g. causing rock falls, using local wildlife, etc.). “Dual Wield Flurry” – If
Kaie successfully hits an opponent with one dagger, she can immediately spend 1 Fate point to make a
second attack on the same target with the off-hand (or apply a “Bleeding” aspect instead of damage).
“Reach Healer” – Once per session, Kaie can tend wounds with herb lore: spend a scene and clear an ally’s
mild physical consequence (or reduce a moderate to mild) using her poultices and Old Gods chants – a bit
of quasi-magic herbcraft.
Stress: 3 physical, 2 mental. Light armor (leather): Armor: 1 vs physical.
Recruitment: Kaie appears in the No One Escapes Cidhna Mine Forsworn quest – she’s the one equipping
Madanach and the escaping prisoners. If the PCs sided with Madanach, Kaie is essentially an ally then. After that quest (during Side Plot C or Act II), Kaie can be the Forsworn contact who remains friendly to
the PCs. She might follow Madanach’s orders to observe the war from the shadows and aid the PCs if it
furthers Forsworn interests (like weakening the Nords or striking at Thalmor or Silverblood influences). The
PC can officially recruit her either by: earning Madanach’s explicit blessing (“Go, be our voice/eyes among
them” – likely if PC brokered peace between Forsworn and Stormcloaks in one of Side Plot outcomes), or by
personal bond (if a PC is Forsworn heritage or showed kindness to the Reachfolk, Kaie trusts them, coming
to aid when asked). If neither of those, possibly a Dragonbreak scenario might involve Forsworn (like Red
Eagle’s Curse). If the PCs spared her or worked together there, she might volunteer. She won’t join an
Imperial-allied party unless they convince her it’ll help oust the Thalmor or protect the Reach in the end
(tough sell – perhaps if they vow the Reach will have autonomy later). She’s more amenable to Stormcloaks
21
if the PC is sympathetic to Forsworn plight (maybe a PC convinced Ulfric to pardon Madanach in some
timeline). Essentially, she’s a wildcard ally – not aligned to either side but to Forsworn survival. If PCs take a
stance to minimize civilian harm in Reach or treat with Forsworn, she’s in.
Romance: Kaie is focused and slow to trust, but a PC who shares her love for the Reach’s wild beauty and
fights by her side against common foes could kindle something. Perhaps a Breton or Nord PC who is an
outsider to both Nords and Reachfolk fits – two people between worlds finding commonality. A romance
would be kept low-key; she might teach the PC a few words of the old Reach tongue or paint woad symbols
on them for protection (an intimate gesture in her culture). Mechanically, a romanced Kaie might allow the
PC to call upon Forsworn aid easier (because through her, Madanach trusts them – effectively giving access
to an aspect “Friend of the Reachmen” more readily). Also, it sets up dramatic tension if the PC’s other allies
hate Forsworn. She could get jealous or angry if the PC does something aligning with Nord interests that
hurt Forsworn. This relationship would be fraught with external pressures (good drama).
Personal Quest Hook: “Bridge Over Blood” – Kaie’s end-goal, if she dreams big, might be to secure a
genuine peace or alliance between Forsworn and whichever side the PCs back. She might ask the PCs to
help her arrange a secret meeting between Madanach and a Nord Jarl (or Galmar/Tullius depending) to
discuss ceasefire in the Reach. This could be a delicate diplomatic scene, very dangerous (centuries of hate
in one room). The PCs would have to mediate strongly. Success could mean by Act IV, the Forsworn send a
token force to help fight Thalmor (e.g. a few deadly hagravens turn on the Thalmor instead of attacking
Markarth). Failure could mean a violent fallout – maybe Madanach is assassinated at the meeting (by an
impatient Nord or a Thalmor agent) and Kaie’s hopes are dashed (she might spiral into despair or
vengeance mode). This quest can significantly impact Markarth’s state in the finale. Another hook: “The New
Way” – Kaie contemplates that the old Forsworn ways (human sacrifice, etc.) are holding them back from
gaining sympathy. She’s not entirely on board with all of Madanach’s vicious methods. The PC can
encourage her to lead a more moderate splinter of Forsworn (maybe uniting with Karthwatch village or
other Reach folk who dislike violence). This could tie to giving the Forsworn a future post-war: the “Tribe of
Kaie” that integrates somewhat with a free Skyrim, fulfilling partly the prophecy of Red Eagle in a less
bloody way. If the PC helps her set up a refuge where Forsworn and Nords begin to coexist (maybe around
the story of a marriage between a Forsworn and a townsperson?), it’d be a huge cultural shift. Mechanically
just narrative, but thematically rich. She might then retire from adventuring to guide her people, but always
as an ally contact.
Usage: Kaie provides stealth and melee support. She’s excellent for infiltration missions (knows how to slip
into Markarth or forts via secret ways). As a former(?) “terrorist,” she understands asymmetric warfare – the
GM can use her to suggest plans like sabotage, pincer ambushes, or alternative routes the armies wouldn’t
consider. Her outsider perspective can also challenge Nord/Imperial rhetoric in dialogue: e.g., if a Jarl says
“Skyrim for the Nords!” Kaie may mutter “What of the people who were here before your Nords?” –
prompting PCs to think about the bigger picture. In battle, she pairs well with ranged or magical PCs by
keeping enemies off them (fast strikes). She might mark high-value targets (like lopping off a standard
bearer’s head to throw enemy troops into confusion – an advantage aspect). But watch her temper: if Silver-
Blood or certain trigger topics arise (like mention of “savage Reachmen”), she could act rashly. It’s an
opportunity for players to either rein her in or let her express fury (with consequences). Overall, Kaie adds a
layer of moral grey and cultural depth to the party, representing the oft-ignored third faction of the war.
(The above are just a selection of possible companions. For brevity, not every potential follower is detailed here –
GMs can similarly craft profiles for others (e.g. Serana the vampire, Delphine the Blade, Brynjolf the thief, etc.) if
they become relevant in your campaign. Use the format provided: Aspects capturing their story role, a Trouble that
generates drama, a couple strengths via stunts, and what it takes for the PCs to earn their loyalty. Remember to
22
keep companions one step behind the PCs’ spotlight – they advise, assist and occasionally shine in their subplots,
but they should not solve core challenges or overshadow the heroes.)
Using Companions in Fate: When a companion accompanies the party, you can represent them with a scaled-
down stat block or simply as an Aspect on the party (“Ralof’s Stormcloak Support” which PCs can invoke for
combat help or war actions). For more interactive play, treat them as Nameless NPC allies rolling at a fixed
bonus (e.g. Lydia rolls +3 when defending her Thane, Aela rolls +4 shooting a target due to expertise). They
typically won’t have Fate points of their own, but the PCs or GM can invoke their aspects (spending PCs’ pool
or via compels) to influence scenes. E.g., compel Hadvar’s Conflicted Honor to create a moment where he
hesitates to cut down a Nord brigand who surrendered, unless a PC spurs him. Also manage the size of the
party: if too many companions tag along, consider narratively splitting them (e.g. sending one to handle a
side objective or guard a location) so that player characters remain central. Each companion’s Trust Clock
(see INTEGRATION_NOTES) can be used to gauge how far they’d go for the group. At full trust, a companion
might sacrifice themselves or disobey their original faction for the PCs. At low trust, they might desert or
even oppose the PCs if ideology clashes (though this would usually only happen via story, not randomly).
Keep an eye on their Troubles for roleplay cues: these often lead to great character moments or side
missions initiated by the companion.*
