# J’zargo – Ambitious Khajiit Apprentice Mage.

J’zargo – Ambitious Khajiit Apprentice Mage.
High Concept: Overconfident Khajiit Sorcerer (A student at the College of Winterhold who believes he will be
the most powerful mage in Skyrim 44 ).
Trouble: Ego Bigger Than Winterhold (J’zargo’s vanity and competitive streak often land him in trouble or
make cooperation tricky. He hates being outshone and may take unwise risks to prove himself).
Aspect: “Bright College, Dark Secrets” (As a College apprentice, J’zargo has knowledge of magic and access to
resources, but also knowledge of some unsanctioned spells or rumors like the Eye of Magnus aftermath –
he might have pilfered a few dangerous scrolls for personal experiments 45 ).
Aspect: Feline Reflexes (Quick on his feet and sly – whether dodging traps or slipping out of blame, J’zargo
19
uses his natural grace and cunning).
Skills: Good Arcana (Magic), Good Will, Fair Athletics (surprisingly athletic, perhaps due to being a Khajiit),
Fair Deceive (fast-talking when his experiments misfire). He specializes in Destruction magic (particularly
shock spells 46 ) and is adept at self-taught enchantments. Combat-wise, he’ll cast from the backline; not
physically strong but nimble.
Stunts: “J’zargo’s Superior Scrolls” – Once per session, J’zargo produces a custom scroll he’s been working
on, allowing a one-time spell effect (create a potent advantage or attack) without costing him stress – e.g. a
scroll of fireball cascade to clear a room. However, there’s a 1 in 4 chance (GM can roll a d4) it backfires (place
a “Unstable Spell Residue” aspect on the scene). “Khajiit Smells Trouble” – +2 to Notice checks involving
detecting magical anomalies or traps (literal keen senses and cautious instinct in dangerous areas).
“Magical Duelist” – +2 to Attack or Defend with Destruction magic when facing a single magical opponent
(his bravado shines in one-on-one contests of skill).
Stress: 2 physical, 3 mental (high Will buffers his mental track). He has 1 mild consequence slot, 1
moderate.
Recruitment: During the College of Winterhold faction quest (Side Plot C), the PC might have befriended or
impressed J’zargo – for instance, by testing his flame cloak scrolls and surviving. If a PC is Arch-Mage or
a respected mage, J’zargo would jump at the chance to accompany them (“Greatest mage in Skyrim travels
with J’zargo, this will be excellent for J’zargo’s fame” he’d say). Even if the PCs aren’t mages, they could
recruit him by appealing to his ambition: e.g. “We’re taking on the Thalmor – think of the glory, J’zargo!” or if
they praise him (“Only a mage of your caliber could help with this task.”). Flattery goes far; he’ll boast but
accept. Be careful: if the PCs treat him like a mere follower or belittle him, he could wander off until
convinced otherwise. He is not aligned to Empire or Stormcloak particularly – he cares about power and
safety of the College. After the Eye of Magnus incident, he’s likely aware of big dangers, so the promise of
adventure and magical advancement lures him. He might also join if they save his tail: maybe during a
Dragonbreak creature scenario, they rescue him from something like a Magic Anomaly outbreak or a cage
of Falmer in a ruin; he’ll pledge temporary service “until debt is repaid” (which can turn permanent as
friendship forms).
Romance: J’zargo is flirtatious but mostly with an ulterior motive (status). A genuine romance is unlikely
because he’s self-centered – unless a PC genuinely breaks through his ego. Perhaps a fellow mage PC from
the College (a rivalry turning into respect then affection trope). If romanced, expect humorous and prideful
interactions (“J’zargo supposes he can share the spotlight with you, since you are nearly as brilliant”). It
could soften him – character growth: he learns humility and care. Mechanically not necessary, but if so,
maybe he thinks twice before a rash act if his beloved urges caution (he could get a +2 to resist provocation
or ego-based compels if reminded of someone he cares for).
Personal Quest Hook: “Experimentation Gone Wrong” – One of J’zargo’s personal projects misfires
catastrophically. E.g., he enchanted some skeever to be invisibly explosive (who knows with him), and now
something’s threatening Winterhold or himself. The PCs must help contain the fallout – could be as simple
as retrieving a runaway scroll that summons storm atronachs endlessly. During this, J’zargo might confront
some humility: PCs see a vulnerable side as he admits he’s slightly out of his depth. Reward: he becomes a
bit more cautious (maybe swap a stunt or aspect to reflect learning) and the College seniors trust the PCs
more for cleaning up (resource boon). Another angle: “The Path to Mastery” – J’zargo wants to become Arch-
Mage one day. He asks the PCs to help him find notable spells or a teacher. This could tie to finding an
ancient tome in a ruin or consulting Neloth in Solstheim (if one wants a cameo). Success might grant J’zargo
a new spell (maybe he learns Lightning Storm, a high-level Destruction spell, giving him a potent attack
once). And he’ll be more loyal, acknowledging he didn’t do it alone (character growth). Also consider his
rivalry: he often competes with Onmund and Brelyna. If PCs helped those two with something instead of
him, he’ll be snippy. A fun mini-quest: a duel between J’zargo and another mage (or even a PC mage) where
the PC can referee or bet on outcome. The result affects his self-image.

Usage: J’zargo brings comic relief and raw firepower. He often talks in third person (“J’zargo has succeeded
in doing what few Khajiit have done!”) which can lighten tense scenes. In combat, he’s artillery: cast aspects
like “Electrocuted” on enemies or simply deal damage. One must manage his Area of Effect spells to not fry
allies – a good running gag and tactical consideration (PCs might yell “Watch your aim!”). Out of combat,
he’s the one bragging in taverns (could unintentionally spread the party’s deeds or plans – a compel
opportunity if needed to hook a new plot). He can also help with magical challenges: deciphering runes,
identifying potions, etc., but he might exaggerate knowledge (a GM can use him to feed players info –
sometimes correct, sometimes requiring verification). Because of his ego, he could cause small conflicts
(like irritating a Jarl’s court wizard or a Thalmor battlemage by claiming superiority – possibly triggering a
duel scenario the PCs must smooth over). All in all, J’zargo’s presence is great to show not all allies are
humble warriors – some are flashy and potentially troublesome, but also powerful if pointed in the right
direction.
