# Hadvar of Solitude – Imperial Soldier and Steadfast Guardian.

Hadvar of Solitude – Imperial Soldier and Steadfast Guardian.
High Concept: Loyal Legion Forester (Nord born in Riverwood serving the Imperial Legion, pragmatic and
duty-bound) 35.
Trouble: Conflicted Honor (hates what the war makes him do – e.g. executing fellow Nords – and privately
questions some orders).
Aspect: Uncle Alvor’s Wisdom (grounded upbringing – his blacksmith uncle taught him to protect the
innocent; gives him humility and folksy problem-solving).
Aspect: “Skyrim’s Unity, Empire’s Strength” (Believes the Empire is Skyrim’s best hope for peace 37 , but also
15
that Skyrim’s people must be protected – he tries to bridge understanding).
Skills: Great Athletics (sturdy fighter who can march and swim in armor), Great Fight (Sword & Shield),
Good Tactics (Strategy), Fair Diplomacy/Rapport (especially with other soldiers or persuading hold guards
– he has official clout).
Stunts: “Shield-Brother” – Once per conflict, Hadvar can interpose his shield to negate a hit on an adjacent
ally (turning a successful hit on a PC into a mere glancing blow, reducing its shift by 2). “Legion Discipline”
– +2 to resist fear or chaos effects (Will rolls), reflecting his military training and calm under fire. He also
carries a horn that when blown can create aspect “Legion Rally” granting allies +1 to morale-based rolls
(once per session).
Stress: 3 physical, 2 mental.
Recruitment: If the PCs fled Helgen with Hadvar or later side with the Empire (e.g. help at the Jagged
Crown or rescue Hadvar’s patrol from a trap), he’ll extend friendship 38. By Act II, after Battle for
Whiterun (if Imperial), Hadvar is assigned to a special attachment with the PC’s unit (effectively available as a
companion). If PCs are neutral, they might still recruit him by proving honorable intentions – Hadvar is
reasonable. For example, if a Stormcloak PC spares Hadvar’s life in battle or helps his family (say, protect
Alvor’s smithy from a Stormcloak raid), he might, against protocol, ally for a greater good (likely in secrecy).
He won’t join openly Stormcloak-allied parties unless there’s a larger threat (like mutually fighting Thalmor)
– then he acts as liaison.
Romance: Possible. Hadvar is single and spends so much time soldiering he’s a bit shy in romance. A PC
who is gentle and forthright can court him. He respects strength and kindness – perhaps a Redguard or
Breton PC in the Legion, or even a clever Nord rebel who shows him not all Stormcloaks are “savages,” could
spark something. A romance with Hadvar likely involves quiet moments in camp where he opens up about
his fears (e.g. “I’m haunted by faces of those we executed at Helgen…”). If romanced and his lover leans
Stormcloak, expect some soul-searching scenes – he might even contemplate desertion for them. Fate-wise,
a romance could grant each a boost when protecting one another or persuading their factions to
compromise (he could speak on the PC’s behalf to Tullius, giving a +2 situational bonus in negotiations).
Personal Quest Hook: “Hadvar’s Oath” – Hadvar confides that General Tullius has ordered something
troubling (e.g. use of Skyrim locals as bait or harsh treatment of Talos worshipers) that conflicts with
Hadvar’s conscience. He asks the PC’s advice or help to resolve it without disobeying outright. Perhaps
they can find a third solution (e.g. fake the operation so innocents escape harm). How this is handled could
affect Act III: if Hadvar sees the Empire he believes in upholding noble values, his resolve strengthens
(Aspect “Inspired Legionnaire” – he grants +1 to allied troops’ morale when present). If forced to partake in
an atrocity, he may develop a Crisis of Faith aspect “Doubt in the Empire” which could be compelled by the
GM to have him hesitate or even switch sides later. Alternatively, Hadvar’s Family: A side quest where Alvor
(his uncle) or Dorthe (little cousin) are endangered – maybe caught in crossfire or kidnapped by a warlord
bandit capitalizing on the chaos. The PCs and Hadvar can undertake a rescue, solidifying his loyalty to them
forever. This also underscores what he fights for – not medals, but people like his kin. Completing it grants a
group Aspect “Hearth-Fire Resolve” (once invokeable when defending homes or families in the story).
Usage: Hadvar is the quintessential good soldier – use him as the party’s moral compass from the Imperial
side. He’ll suggest non-lethal solutions (“Do we have to kill these Stormcloak prisoners? They could be…
rehabilitated.”) and can serve as a spokesperson to Imperial authorities (“Legate, with respect, these men
saved my life. We should listen to them.”). In combat, he’s by-the-book: forming shield walls, guarding
flanks. Mechanically, let him create advantages like “Shield Wall Formed” or “Enemy Distracted by Shield
Taunt” to aid PCs. He pairs well if a PC is sneaky or magical – he covers them physically while they do their
work. Players often trust Hadvar because he’s straightforward and brave 39 , so he’s a reliable companion
figure.
