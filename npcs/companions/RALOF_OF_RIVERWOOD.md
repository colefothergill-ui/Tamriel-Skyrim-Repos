# Ralof of Riverwood – Stormcloak Tracker and True Nord.

Ralof of Riverwood – Stormcloak Tracker and True Nord.
High Concept: Devoted Stormcloak Commando (Nord scout from Riverwood, fiercely loyal to Skyrim’s
freedom).
Trouble: Haunted by Helgen (survivor’s guilt and nightmares from Alduin’s attack and the Imperial execution
block).
Aspect: Brotherhood Forged in War (forms deep bonds with those who fight alongside him; will risk much for
his “shield-brothers/sisters”).
Skills: Excellent Survival/Notice, Great Fight (Two-Handed), Good Stealth, Average Influence
(charismatic among Nords). He’s a skilled tracker and skirmisher, favoring a battleaxe or longbow.
Stunts: “Guerilla Tactics” – Ralof can create an advantage related to terrain (“Ambush Position”, “Cover of
Trees”) with +2 once per session by recalling his scout training. “Stormcloak Courage” – +2 to Defend allies
with Fight when outnumbered, reflecting his rallying presence in battle.
Stress: 3 physical, 2 mental. Consequences: Standard (Mild, Moderate).
Recruitment: If the PCs escaped Helgen with Ralof or later join the Stormcloaks and prove themselves (e.g.
help at Fort Neugrad rescue or Jagged Crown quest) 32 33 , Ralof regards them as trustworthy. He
formally offers to accompany them after Act I’s Battle for Whiterun if Stormcloak-aligned. Even if the party
isn’t Stormcloak, saving his life or showing honor (like sparing Nordic lives or helping Riverwood) could
persuade him. He won’t join overt Imperials, though he might still aid them quietly against mutual foes like
the Thalmor.
Romance: Possible. Ralof is straight (per lore mentions of a past love), but more importantly he’s “married to
Skyrim’s cause.” A PC who shares his ideology might kindle something; scenes of quiet camaraderie
(drinking mead by the campfire swapping stories of home) can build a romance. If romanced and things
look dire (e.g. Ulfric orders something cruel), Ralof’s loyalty could be torn – a dramatic personal quest where
the PC’s influence may make him an agent of change in the rebellion (maybe preventing an atrocity).
Personal Quest Hook: “Stormcloak’s Heart” – Ralof confides doubts about Ulfric’s methods after seeing war’s
toll on civilians. He admits he’d follow Ulfric to Sovngarde, but wonders if there’s a better way to win
Skyrim’s freedom. The PCs can encourage his conscience. In Act IV, this may pay off: if present during
Ulfric’s victory, Ralof might step in and stop Ulfric from executing a captive Elisif, echoing that conscience. Mechanically, Ralof’s growth can grant the party an aspect “Mercy on the Battlefield” to invoke in
peace talks or to mitigate civilian casualties. Alternatively, a darker quest: Ralof discovers his sister Gerdur’s
family (in Riverwood) is targeted by Thalmor assassins as leverage. The PCs and Ralof can rush to Riverwood
to thwart this – securing Ralof’s unwavering loyalty (and a burning hatred for the Thalmor, adding +2 to any
rolls against them as a temporary aspect “Vengeful Protector”).
Usage: Ralof is an ideal companion for Stormcloak-leaning parties or those with Nord cultural ties. He
offers guidance on Stormcloak operations (he knows the holds and secret paths) and a grounded, hearty
presence that players often gravitate to. He’s good for pointing out when something dishonorable is afoot
(“This isn’t what we bled for…”). Tactically, use him to set up ambush aspects or watch the party’s back
during stealth missions.
