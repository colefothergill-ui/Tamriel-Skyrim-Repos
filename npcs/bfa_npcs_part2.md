Princess Tess Greymane – Heir to the Worgen Legacy
Act III – Darkshore Warfront: After the Burning of Teldrassil, Tess leads Gilnean forces to aid the
night elves in Darkshore. Quest – “Wolves of Darkshore”: The PC joins Tess and Lorna Crowley
in guerrilla strikes against Horde occupiers. Tess strives to prove Gilneas’s loyalty to the Kaldorei. 
Choice: Protect a village of kaldorei refugees or ambush a Horde supply caravan. 
Trust Path: Prioritizing the refugees impresses Tess; she sees the PC’s empathy. In battle, she fights
fiercely at the PC’s side, earning her respect. (Gain Aspect: Gilnean Ally – Tess’s royal guards
recognize the PC on sight.) 
Duty Path: Focusing on the ambush secures a tactical win but at civilian cost. Tess outwardly praises
the victory but privately questions if it was worth the price. (PC gains Stunt: Night Guerilla – +2 to
stealth attacks in night forests, but Tess’s trust doesn’t deepen yet.) 
Act IV – The Worgen’s Burden: Haunted by her people’s suffering, Tess contemplates taking the
Worgen curse to better understand her subjects. Quest – “Curse or Crown”: Tess and the PC
consult druid Vassandra Stormclaw in Duskwood, where Goldrinn’s essence tests Tess in a dream
world. The PC accompanies her through an Emerald Dream vision of the Gilnean fall. 
Guidance Path: The PC gently guides Tess through the nightmare of losing control to rage. Tess
experiences her brother Liam’s death and nearly succumbs to feral wrath. If the PC keeps her
grounded—reminding her of duty and balance—Tess awakens realizing she need not become a
worgen to lead. Her gratitude is profound (Gain Bond: Tess considers the PC a confidant; they
receive Title Greyguard Honorary Captain, joining her elite guard). 
Temptation Path: If the PC encourages Tess’s darker impulses (perhaps suggesting true empathy
requires living the curse), Tess’s dream-self embraces the fury. She awakens unsettled, now
determined to undergo the ritual for real. This reckless decision triggers a secret ritual where Tess
comes close to being bitten by an ancient Worgen. The PC can still intervene last-minute; if not, Tess
is cursed but unstable. (This Betrayal Path yields Aspect: Uncontrolled Worgen on Tess – she
disappears to grapple with her new curse, and the PC loses her trust, gaining an enemy in Genn’s
eyes for enabling his daughter’s peril.) 
Personal Arc Resolution: In the finale of the campaign, Tess’s fate (cured or not) influences the
Alliance. If trusted, she knights the PC as a Hero of Gilneas during the Alliance council epilogue. If betrayed, Tess’s absence or affliction leaves Gilneas in turmoil, costing the Alliance a valuable
ally in the final battles. 
Rewards: Achieving full trust with Tess grants the PC Tess’s Signet Ring, a token of Gilnean royalty
(invoke for political leverage among Alliance nobles). The PC also gains a Stunt: Howl of Goldrinn –
once per session, invoke the ancient worgen spirit to intimidate foes (mental attack +2) or bolster
allies’ courage. In the alternate path where Tess becomes a Worgen, the PC may instead loot Tess’s
Silver Flasket, a vial of potent Worgen antidote (an expendable Aspect that can cure or suppress
one curse or mind-control effect). 
Romance: Tess Greymane is strong-willed and duty-bound. If the PC is of similar age and earns her
trust, a slow-burn romance can blossom. Through late-night strategizing and shared grief over lost
loved ones, Tess opens her heart. A romantic path yields Aspect: Heart of the Future Queen –
representing a deep bond (each can invoke this to aid the other in dire moments). Tess’s romance arc
might culminate in a heartfelt scene where she offers the PC a place by her side in rebuilding Gilneas
(and perhaps an elegant Gilnean wolfhawk mount as a personal gift). •

Alleria Windrunner – Void’s Embrace
Act II – The Banishment and the Light: As the Alliance war effort ramps up, Alleria seeks to recruit
her estranged kin. Quest – “Shadows in the Sunwell”: Alleria covertly invites the PC (a Sin’dorei/
Quel’dorei character) to accompany her to Silvermoon. She hopes to sway the Blood Elves to rejoin
the Alliance. In a tense diplomatic visit, Alleria’s void energies disturb the Sunwell, prompting the
Blood Elf leadership to banish her. Choice: help Alleria calm the Void within her to safely
withdraw, or defend her from enraged guards as you escape Silvermoon. 
Peaceful Retreat: The PC channels Alleria’s teachings to contain the void flare. This prevents conflict
and saves face. Though Lor’themar orders them gone, Alleria is grateful for the PC’s level head. (Gain
Aspect: Touched by the Void – the PC shows an affinity for resisting void corruption, which Alleria
notices.) 
Violent Exit: If the PC chooses aggression, they fight through a few Blood Elf sentries to cover
Alleria’s escape. This cements Alleria’s reputation as a pariah in Quel’Thalas. She disapproves of
shedding blood of her former people, even if provoked. (PC gains Stunt: Void Flanker – +2 to Combat
when fighting alongside Alleria’s shadow powers, but Alliance diplomats eye them warily.) 
Act III – War Campaign (Alliance): Alleria co-leads Alliance covert ops in Kul Tiras and Zandalar. 
Quest – “Shadows Unbound”: Alleria senses a Void rift on Zandalar—leftover from Prophet Zul’s
rituals. She asks the PC to help seal it before Sylvanas’s forces exploit it. In this mission, the PC must
balance Alleria’s Void powers with Shandris Feathermoon’s Light -blessed hunters who join the team.
The Void starts whispering to all present. Choice: Rely on Alleria’s void magic to overwhelm the
enemy quickly, or heed Shandris’s caution to use conventional tactics. 
Void Empowerment: Letting Alleria unleash the Void leads to swift victory over Zul’s crazed minions,
but at a cost—Alleria nearly loses herself to the whispers. The PC can talk her down (if they fail,
Alleria’s eyes flash with dark resolve, alarming everyone). Success deepens Alleria’s trust: “You kept
me anchored when darkness beckoned.” (Unlock Stunt: Void Channeler – the PC can tap Alleria’s
void insight once per session to reroll a failed Lore or Will roll, reflecting shared void knowledge.) 
Measured Approach: If the PC restrains Alleria’s usage of void magic, the fight is harder but the
team remains balanced. Alleria reluctantly holds back; Shandris’s strategy prevails. Alleria respects
the PC’s prudence, though she feels a pang of disappointment at not using her full potential. (PC
gains Aspect: Trust of the Sentinel from Shandris, but Alleria’s personal bond grows more slowly.) 
Act V – Visions of N’Zoth: Alleria grows obsessed with the Old God threat after N’Zoth’s escape. 
Quest – “Whispers in the Dark”: Outside Orgrimmar at Razor Hill, Alleria and Vereesa join the rebel
Horde and Alliance forces planning Sylvanas’s downfall. Alleria argues that Sylvanas’s amassed forces
might be needed to face N’Zoth, suggesting the rebels delay their attack. The PC can influence
this pivotal debate. 
Convince Alleria to Commit: The PC (especially if Alliance) sides with Anduin and Saurfang –
Sylvanas must be stopped now. Alleria is swayed by the PC’s resolve that we “cannot fight two
wars at once”. She commits fully to the battle at Orgrimmar, scouting the enemy lines and
providing void cover. Together, you witness Saurfang’s Mak’gora. After Sylvanas’s defeat, Alleria
thanks the PC for keeping her focused. (Gain Aspect: Void’s Vigilant – Alleria entrusts the PC as a
void-attuned lookout against future Old God whispers.) 
Support Alleria’s Caution: Alternatively, the PC (perhaps privy to void insight) agrees with Alleria’s
fears – maybe Sylvanas could help against N’Zoth. This minority stance causes tension; Anduin
overrules it. Later, Alleria privately confides in the PC her lingering worry that the war cost
precious time against the Old God. Although Sylvanas fled, Alleria’s gratitude for the PC’s
understanding strengthens their personal bond (even if others doubted you). •

Personal Quest – “The Void’s Gift” (Special Scenario for Thalassian PCs): If the player character is a
Blood Elf (Sin’dorei) or High Elf (Quel’dorei), Alleria offers a unique path: Embrace the Void. One
evening after the war, Alleria approaches the PC with an earnest proposal: “Let me guide you to
harness the shadows as I have. Will you become one of the Ren’dorei – the Void Elves?” She extends her
hand, crackling with amethyst void energy, promising new power and purpose. This questline can
occur regardless of the PC’s current faction, representing a momentous personal choice. 
Acceptance – Rite of the Ren’dorei: Alleria brings the willing PC to the Telogrus Rift, the void-
touched remnants of a world. There, the PC undergoes a ritual under Alleria and Locus-Walker’s
supervision. They face a manifestation of the Void – perhaps a dark reflection of themselves or a
minor Old God echo – in a test of will. Success: The PC overcomes the whispers just as Alleria did,
emerging as one of the first mortals after her to defy the shadow’s lure. Their blood transforms,
hair and eyes taking on Void’s purple hue. Alleria formally welcomes them to the Ren’dorei. Faction
Change: A former Horde blood elf is now considered Alliance (Alleria makes arrangements for their
sanctuary in Stormwind). The PC gains Massive Rewards: a full set of Void-touched armor and a
distinctive weapon (e.g. a bow or blade infused with the Void). Mechanically, the PC acquires the 
Extra “Voidform” – an aspect and stunt bundle per Fate’s Bronze Rule. For example, Aspect:
Embraced by the Void (invoke for shadow magic or stealthy influence) and Stunts: (1) Entropic
Embrace: Once per conflict, tap into void energy to gain +2 to an attack or create an advantage
(manifests as swirling shadows empowering the blow); (2) Spatial Rift: Twice per session, instantly
reposition up to one zone away as a minor teleport – a legacy of the void elf racial ability.
Additionally, the PC can assume a Void Form in extreme situations – enveloping themselves in dark
power for a short time (treat as a boost granting +4 on one overcome roll, but at risk of a GM compel
representing the Void’s whispers). Alleria herself gifts a personal item, such as a Void-touched locket,
symbolizing the PC’s rebirth. 
Rejection – Clinging to the Light: If the PC declines Alleria’s offer, preferring to remain Sin’dorei/
Quel’dorei, Alleria respects the choice. “The void is not a path for everyone,” she admits. The PC keeps
their current faction loyalties. They do not gain the void elf powers, but their steadfast identity
grants a different boon: Stunt: Unbroken Allegiance – +2 to Will when resisting mental influence that
would make them betray their faction or personal ideals. Alleria, while disappointed, still values the
PC’s aid; if Alliance, they remain friends, and if Horde, there’s a bittersweet farewell as diplomatic
equals. 
Resolution and Legacy: If the PC became a Void Elf, their new status can dramatically alter the
campaign’s course. Horde former allies may shun or even hunt them; Alliance leaders (and Alleria’s
own void elves) hail them as an asset. The final battles against N’Zoth see the PC playing a critical
role: their void powers might allow them to decipher N’Zoth’s whispers or shut down void portals. In
the epilogue, Alleria stands proudly with the PC as the Alliance’s newest hero of the Void. If the PC
remained true to their original path, they may instead broker peace between void elves and others,
having earned respect from both sides. 
Rewards: Aside from the above Void’s Gift rewards, Alleria’s personal trust yields Alleria’s Insignia, a
rune-inscribed talisman. (It grants the Aspect: Void Ranger’s Favor – once per session, Alleria can be
invoked as an ally to assist in a task, such as sniping a key target or shielding the PC’s mind from
madness.) The PC also gains a deeper understanding of the Void: Stunt: Shadow Hunter – +2 to
Notice or Investigate when detecting magic or hidden entities influenced by Void or Old Gods (from
Alleria’s training). If the PC’s relationship was strained in any branch, Alleria may withhold deeper
secrets, and the lack of her insight could make confronting N’Zoth more perilous. 
Romance: Alleria is married – her heart belongs to Turalyon, who returned with her from Argus.
Thus, a romantic arc with Alleria is not available, remaining lore-accurate. However, the PC can still
develop a profound platonic bond with her, akin to a protégé-mentor relationship in mastering the•

void. (If a player absolutely insists on romance, the GM could introduce an illusory temptress in
N’Zoth’s visions taking Alleria’s form, but that would be a trick of the Old God, not genuine love.)
Alleria’s story in this campaign focuses on friendship, mentorship, and the dangerous seduction of
power rather than new love. 
Baine Bloodhoof – Honor, Ancestry, and Rebellion
Act I – Before the Storm: In the prologue to war, Baine fights alongside Sylvanas as duty demands,
but the PC notices his unease with her ruthless tactics (like the blighting of Alliance soldiers at
Lordaeron). Quest – “The High Chieftain’s Dilemma”: After the Battle of Teldrassil and Siege of
Lordaeron, the PC (if Horde) is summoned to Baine’s camp. Surrounded by wounded Tauren
warriors, Baine confides his worries to the PC in a quiet moment. He ponders whether honor still has
a place in the Horde. Choice: Encourage Baine to stand up to Sylvanas’s cruelty now, or advise
patience and loyalty until a better moment. 
Encouragement (Trust): The PC’s affirmation emboldens Baine. He publicly objects during a War
Council when Sylvanas proposes a dishonorable act (such as raising fallen night elf sentinels).
Though this earns a sharp reprimand from the Warchief, Baine later thanks the PC: “Your courage
gives me strength to follow my conscience.” (PC gains Aspect: Baine’s Confidence – in future, Baine
involves the PC in sensitive plans, trusting their counsel.) 
Caution (Duty): Urging Baine to bide his time leads him to remain outwardly compliant a bit longer.
He nods gravely and says, “Perhaps you are right… for my people’s sake.” The Horde war machine rolls
on, and Baine masks his dissent. (PC gains Aspect: Under Sylvanas’s Eye – Sylvanas’s agents note the
PC as “loyal,” granting easier access to certain Horde operations, but Baine’s personal trust grows
slowly.) 
Act III – A Traitor’s Heart: As the war progresses, Sylvanas commits darker deeds. The turning point
comes when she resurrects Derek Proudmoore – planning to weaponize him against the Alliance.
Baine’s breaking point is reached. Quest – “Chains of Honor”: Baine secretly enlists the PC
and a few like-minded heroes to save Derek Proudmoore from undeath’s servitude. Together, they
infiltrate Sylvanas’s flagship, where Derek is held bound in dark ritual. 
Liberation Path (Canon, Trust): The PC helps Baine and Zelling (an undead ally) disable the wards
and carry Derek out. In a tense stealth escape, they sail to the coast of Theramore. There, Jaina
Proudmoore arrives (alerted by a tip from Baine’s friend Valeera). Initially furious—thinking it a trap
—Jaina is calmed when Derek himself speaks with his own free will. This emotional reunion only
happens if the PC ensured Derek was kept safe and sane (e.g. slaying the Apothecary mid-ritual so
Derek wasn’t brainwashed). Baine personally delivers Derek to Jaina, an act of immense trust. 
Outcome: Sylvanas discovers the defection. In the subsequent War Council scene, Baine openly
admits his role, condemning Sylvanas for her dishonor. She has Baine arrested on the spot. The
PC, if present, may be forced to flee or also get captured depending on their standing. Regardless,
Baine’s trust in the PC is now unshakeable – they saved not only Derek but Baine’s own soul from
complicity. (PC gains Aspect: Honorable Renegade – representing their known stance against
Sylvanas’s tyranny, respected by Saurfang’s rebellion and Alliance alike.) 
Loyalist Path (Betrayal): The PC, if still fiercely loyal to Sylvanas (perhaps due to earlier choices),
might warn Nathanos Blightcaller of Baine’s treason or intentionally sabotage the rescue. In this
grim branch, Sylvanas springs a trap: as Baine moves Derek, Horde Dark Rangers ambush. The PC
either stands aside or assists Sylvanas’s forces. Baine and his co-conspirators are overpowered. 
Outcome: Baine is chained and dragged to Orgrimmar’s deepest prison. Sylvanas praises the PC’s
“loyalty” coldly, granting them Stunt: Dark Lady’s Favor – once per session, they may invoke fear in•

Horde ranks to command obedience (a dubious reward). However, this path drastically alters the
story – with Baine slated for execution, the Horde’s chances at internal reform (and alliance with
Saurfang) plummet. The PC has effectively cast their lot with Sylvanas fully, alienating Baine’s
supporters (they gain Aspect (Trouble): Marked as Banshee’s Pawn in eyes of rebels). 
Act IV – Rescue and Reckoning: If Baine is imprisoned (canon outcome of the Trust Path), the
Alliance and Horde rebels mount a daring rescue in Orgrimmar. Quest – “Breaking the
Bloodhoof”: The PC can partake either as a Horde rebel or an Alliance agent. They infiltrate the
Orgrimmar sewer depths where Baine is chained by dark magic, set to be executed for treason.
Jaina Proudmoore, Thrall, and Varok Saurfang coordinate (in-game, this was a major scenario). The
PC faces off against Queen Azshara’s former champion, Dark Warden (a proxy of Sylvanas guarding
Baine). After overcoming traps and Calia Menethil’s plea echoing in the distance (if Alliance), they
free Baine moments before execution. Baine is weak but alive. He clasps the PC’s hand and says, “I
won’t forget this debt.” (If the PC had betrayed Baine earlier, this rescue is done by other NPCs – the
PC might even find themselves fighting against the rescuers in Sylvanas’s name, a dramatic
confrontation with Jaina or Thrall!). 
Outcome: Baine, once free, joins Saurfang and Thrall for the final stand at the gates of Orgrimmar. If
the PC saved him, he roars in battle defending them and stands with Saurfang against Sylvanas. If
the PC betrayed him, Baine confronts the PC directly during the Mak’gora showdown – a tense
moment where he may either try to appeal to their honor or be forced to treat them as an enemy.
Saurfang’s death at Sylvanas’s hands occurs either way, but Baine survives to help pick up the
Horde’s pieces. 
Act V – Reforging the Horde: After Sylvanas’s departure, Baine becomes a key figure in the new
Horde Council. Quest – “By Blood and Honor Reborn”: Baine invites the PC (if Horde) to Thunder
Bluff for a sacred Tauren ceremony. In a heartwarming scene on the bluffs under An’she’s (the sun)
gaze, Baine honors all who stayed true. The PC may receive a Totem-blessing ritual from Tauren
elders – symbolizing unity. If the PC was a betrayer who rejoined the Horde after Sylvanas’s fall, this
is more somber: Baine demands a Maki’tor (Tauren rite of contrition) where the PC must atone
publicly to rejoin the Tauren’s trust. The ending varies: in a trusted path, Baine and the PC are closer
than ever, akin to brothers/sisters in arms, determined to heal Azeroth. In a betrayed path, Baine’s
forgiveness is cautious; the PC might carry a stigma into any future tales. 
Rewards: Trusted: Baine presents the PC with Bloodhoof Chieftain’s War Halberd, a massive
polearm etched with runes of the Earth Mother (it grants Stunt: Earthmother’s Champion – once per
session, the PC can reduce incoming physical harm by 2 or shake the earth in a small area, as the
weapon channels Tauren ancestral spirit). The PC also gains Aspect: Blessing of Thunder Bluff –
revered by Tauren people, receiving aid and hospitality in Tauren lands. Additionally, Baine’s personal
mentorship provides Stunt: An’she’s Guidance – +2 to Empathy or Lore when invoking Tauren culture
or spiritual wisdom (Baine’s teachings help the PC mediate conflicts and understand spiritual
matters). Betrayal: If the PC remained loyal to Sylvanas to the end, rewards come from the Banshee
Queen instead – perhaps Nightmarish Warplate (a dark armor set with an Aspect Fearsome
Reputation ). But these come at the cost of nearly all Horde NPCs’ trust. Importantly, if the PC later
turns coat to the Alliance, Jaina or Anduin might gift a token of thanks for aiding Baine’s eventual
survival (e.g. Proudmoore Family Pendant from Derek/Jaina, an Aspect representing that
diplomatic bridge). 
Romance: Baine is known for his stoic honor and has no canon romantic partner, making him a
candidate for a PC who shares deep camaraderie. A romance would be a slow, respectful courtship—
perhaps a brave warrior woman of the Horde, or even an Alliance PC in a twist of reconciliation. If
pursued, the PC spends quiet moments with Baine, like watching sunrise over Mulgore’s mesas or
honoring the spirits at a campfire. Through these intimate moments, Baine learns to let go of his•

burdens briefly and care for himself and the PC. Romance Outcome: Baine carves a small wooden
carving of a Tauren and their companion (representing the PC’s race) entwined, giving it to the PC as
a promise of unity. A romanced Baine grants Aspect: Heart of the Horned Chieftain – symbolizing a
profound love that inspires both partners to protect each other (invoke for strength or clarity when
fighting side by side). This doesn’t alter major plot points (Baine still upholds duty), but it adds
emotional stakes—if Baine is captured, the PC’s determination to save him can be role-played as
driven by love. Their epilogue might involve Baine inviting the PC to Thunder Bluff permanently,
even a Fate-style marriage under the totem poles (with Baine’s surviving allies performing the rites). 
Valeera Sanguinar – Blade of Friendship
Context: Valeera is a neutral champion, a Blood Elf rogue who swore loyalty to Varian Wrynn and
thus serves the Alliance king (Anduin) while technically unaffiliated with either faction.
Throughout BfA, Valeera operates in the shadows as a messenger and spy, leveraging her ties to
both the Alliance and individuals in the Horde. Her personal quests revolve around covert
missions that could turn the tide of war without mass bloodshed. 
Act III – Secret Correspondence: Anduin entrusts Valeera to handle a delicate situation: Baine
Bloodhoof’s surreptitious reach-out to make amends for a “wrong inflicted on the Proudmoore
family.” This refers to Baine’s plan to return Derek Proudmoore. Quest – “The Pirate’s Cove
Parley”: Valeera takes the PC (likely Alliance, or a trustworthy neutral, as a Horde PC here would be
out of place) on a stealth journey to a meeting at Theramore’s ruins. The objective is to rendezvous
with Baine (who’s bringing Derek). Valeera and the PC sneak onto Wind’s Redemption, Jaina’s Kul
Tiran ship in Boralus harbor, to deliver Baine’s message. The PC must bypass naval guards and
suspicious Proudmoore Marines to get Valeera in to see Jaina and Shaw. 
Stealth Success: If the PC expertly avoids detection (using Rogue skills or clever Create Advantage
actions like distracting a sentry ), Valeera shares Baine’s request to Jaina in secret. Although Jaina is
distrustful seeing a Blood Elf appear, Shaw vouches for Valeera’s friendship to the late Varian.
The meeting is set: Jaina will meet Baine outside Theramore as requested. Valeera gives the PC an
approving nod – mission accomplished quietly. (PC gains Stunt: Cloak and Dagger – +2 to Stealth
when accompanying Valeera or acting on secret missions, reflecting Valeera’s tutelage.) 
If Detected (Alternate Path): Should the PC bungle the infiltration (perhaps a guard catches a
glimpse), they may have to fight or flee. A brief skirmish on the docks might ensue. Valeera hates
needless killing; if the PC subdues guards non-lethally, she’s impressed by their restraint. If they kill
Alliance sailors, Jaina’s arrival is furious – nearly blowing the meeting. Valeera defuses it with her
credibility, but the trust is damaged. (PC gains Consequence: On Watch Lists – one or both factions
have noted the PC’s face from this slip-up, increasing difficulty on future stealth endeavors.)
Nonetheless, the meeting with Baine likely still happens, but under heavier suspicion. 
Act III/IV – Whispers of a Black Prince: After the Battle of Dazar’alor, the war shifts. Valeera’s next
task involves Wrathion and the creeping Old God threat. She works with Mathias Shaw investigating
N’Zoth’s activities. Quest – “In the Shadow of Stormwind”: Valeera invites the PC (either faction,
since this is a united concern) to help investigate a lead: a corrupted Vision of Stormwind that the
Old God N’Zoth created. Within this vision, a dark version of Stormwind City, Valeera and the PC must
find a corrupted SI:7 spymaster (a vision of Shaw) and defeat him to retrieve an artifact. This is a
surreal, mind-bending stealth mission with whispers in the air. Valeera’s void-induced “gossip” lines
hint she’s uneasy. 
Outcome: Successfully navigating the vision (a maze of shifting streets) and resisting N’Zoth’s
illusions results in the PC retrieving critical intel about N’Zoth’s next move. Valeera commends the•

PC’s bravery and rational mind for not succumbing to fear. This solidifies Valeera’s trust: “You handled
that as deftly as any Uncrowned agent.” (Unlock Aspect: Trusted by the Uncrowned – the global rogue
network considers the PC an ally, useful for gathering intel later. Also reflects Valeera’s personal trust
in them.) If they fail (perhaps attacking figments that should be avoided or giving in to a
temptational whisper), Valeera pulls the PC out, but the intel is incomplete – leading to a harder fight
later against N’Zoth’s forces. Valeera still appreciates the effort but is slightly more guarded about
involving the PC in purely stealth missions hereafter. 
Act IV – Meeting of Minds: In the lead-up to the final confrontation with Sylvanas, Valeera arranges
Varok Saurfang’s secret meeting with Anduin. Quest – “Lost Honor, Hidden Dagger”: The PC (if
Horde-loyal to Saurfang or neutral) can be tasked by Valeera to escort Saurfang safely to a discreet
location outside Stormwind where Anduin waits (this recreates events from the Lost Honor
cinematic). The PC must ensure no loyalist spy tracks Saurfang, and perhaps convince Saurfang (and
Zekhan who may be present) that this meeting is wise. Branch: If the PC earlier betrayed Baine and
sided with Sylvanas, they would not be on this mission – instead, the GM could have Valeera in a
cutscene narrowly avoid that PC or leave them a cryptic note, highlighting that Valeera is operating
beyond their reach. 
Outcome: If the PC facilitates the parley without incident, Saurfang returns to the Barrens with
renewed purpose, setting in motion the Horde rebellion. Valeera expresses gratitude: “Few will ever
know what you did this day, but Anduin and I will not forget.” If something goes awry (e.g., a Sylvanas
loyalist followed despite precautions), the PC might end up in a quick skirmish to protect Saurfang’s
free will. A successful defense cements Valeera’s trust; a failure could mean Saurfang is forced to flee
sooner, altering his trajectory (in worst case, if Saurfang were captured or killed here due to PC
negligence, it would drastically alter Act IV – essentially a non-canon catastrophe the GM might
avoid). 
Resolution: Valeera survives the war and is present at its epilogue. If the PC has been her close ally,
she pulls them aside after the Horde council forms. In a quiet moment, she confesses relief that the
conflict’s ending without her having to choose sides against friends. She emphasizes that personal
loyalty kept her going – loyalty to friends like Varian/Anduin, and now the PC. She offers the
PC a permanent spot as her partner for delicate missions in the future (whether in peace
negotiations or hunting lingering Twilight’s Hammer cultists). If trust is low (PC made choices
opposing her ideals), Valeera simply nods and vanishes into the shadows, pursuing her own path. 
Rewards: Valeera’s friendship yields subtle yet valuable boons. She gifts the PC Twin Daggers of the
Uncrowned, elegant blades (or if the PC isn’t a rogue-type, a different weapon of choice) forged in
Dalaran and etched with the crest of the Uncrowned order. They count as an Extra with Stunt:
Shadowstrike – when attacking from hiding or in the first exchange of combat, gain +2 to the roll
(reflecting assassination techniques). The PC also gains Aspect: Friend of the King’s Shadow – meaning
they can call on Alliance contacts or neutral espionage resources thanks to Valeera’s network. This
aspect can be invoked in social situations where credibility as “one who has the ear of Anduin’s
personal spy” helps, or to request minor favors (information, safehouses) from the Uncrowned
rogues. If the PC ever finds themselves in political trouble, Valeera might quietly intervene to pull
strings (at the GM’s discretion, a compel might have her ask for a return favor). 
Romance: Valeera’s loyalties are personal rather than political, and she has no known romantic ties
in canon. A PC who has earned her trust and saved her skin a few times might ignite a spark with the
fiery Blood Elf. Any romance with Valeera would be characterized by witty banter, mutual respect,
and a shared love of adventure. She’s fiercely independent – expect a relationship of equals,
punctuated by playful duels and rooftop meetings. If romanced, Valeera eventually shares the
tragedy of her past (how she lost her family and was enslaved as a gladiator, etc.), opening up in a
way she rarely does. As a symbol of affection, she might give the PC one of her emerald earrings•

(a keepsake from her childhood) or a lockpick that saved her life, saying they “already stole my heart,
might as well have my tools.” The romance grants an Aspect: Heart of the Uncrowned. This can be
invoked when the PC is in mortal peril – perhaps Valeera makes a daring appearance to save her
beloved just in time, or the thought of returning to Valeera gives the PC the will to push through fear.
In a campaign narrative sense, a romantic Valeera could even consider settling down temporarily
after N’Zoth’s defeat, teaching the PC Thalassian recipes in Stormwind or going on a “vacation” to
explore Azeroth free of war—though inevitably, the call of adventure (or a new threat) will pull the
duo back into action. 
Shandris Feathermoon – Sentinel Matriarch in Shadow
Act I – War of the Thorns: As Sylvanas’s Horde invades Ashenvale, Shandris is deceived into leading
much of the Night Elf fleet away (on a false mission to Silithus). By the time she returns,
Teldrassil burns. Quest – “Embers of Darnassus”: The PC (likely Night Elf or Alliance) encounters
Shandris at the Darkshore coast just after the calamity. Amidst survivors’ screams and charred ruins,
Shandris struggles with guilt for “falling for the Horde’s ploy”. She tasks the PC with helping
evacuate as many civilians as possible through portals while she and Maiev Shadowsong hold off
pursuing Horde. This is a frantic, emotional scene. Choice: Rescue more civilians (but risk getting cut
off by the Horde), or obey Shandris’s eventual order to fall back to the fleet (ensuring the PC’s own
escape). 
Heroic Rescue: The PC goes above and beyond, diving into fire or collapsing buildings to pull
trapped civilians (perhaps even finding a lost Gilnean ambassador or a child) and pushing the limits
of time. If they succeed on difficult Athletics/Physique and overcome rolls (or clever use of magic),
Shandris witnesses their selflessness. At the last moment, the PC and a batch of refugees leap
through a portal as Darkshore falls to the Horde. Shandris, eyes wet with gratitude, calls the PC a
true friend of the Kaldorei. (Gain Aspect: Esteem of the Night Elves – Shandris and even Tyrande hear
of the PC’s deeds, earning respect that can aid in any dealings with Night Elf factions.) 
Strategic Retreat: If the PC follows orders strictly, they ensure key military assets and leaders
escape, but some civilians are left behind. Shandris is grimly understanding—she too has sacrificed
sentiment for strategy when necessary. This path doesn’t earn the extra renown, but Shandris trusts
the PC as a disciplined soldier. (PC gains Stunt: Sentinel Tactics – +2 to defend rolls when fighting
alongside Night Elf units, as they recognize the PC’s reliability in following battle plans.) 
Act III – Alliance War Campaign in Zandalar: Shandris becomes a co-commander of Alliance forces
seeking footholds in Zandalar. Quest – “The Vol’dun Plan”: The PC (Alliance) joins Shandris and
Halford Wyrmbane in planning an assault on Vol’dun’s coast. Shandris believes in a precision
strike to cripple Horde supply lines in the desert, while Halford favors a frontal attack on a Zandalari
outpost. Choice: Support Shandris’s plan (stealth and coordination with local smugglers, e.g.
potentially enlisting the Vulpera) or back Wyrmbane’s direct assault. 
Covert Strike (Shandris’s plan): The PC and Shandris undertake a stealth mission to sabotage
Horde cannons overlooking the coast and free a Vulpera caravan that the Horde pressed into
service. Through this, they secure the Alliance landing with minimal casualties. Shandris’s faith in
covert ops is validated. She comments that the PC operates with the finesse of a true Sentinel. (Gain 
Stunt: Desert Ghost – +2 to Stealth or Survival in desert environments, knowledge passed on from
Shandris’s long experience hunting in hostile lands.) Additionally, one grateful Vulpera gives the PC a
keepsake (perhaps a Vulpera Scarf that can be used as an Aspect for gaining local desert allies or
knowledge). •

Siege Attack (Halford’s plan): The PC joins a tank-and-rank assault. The Horde is pushed back but at
higher Alliance losses and a risk of angering neutral Zandalari. Shandris is a consummate soldier
and will fight bravely in either scenario, but if her advice was ignored, she grimly notes the cost. She
still respects the PC’s strength but cautions them later that victory must be weighed against what is
lost ( this insight can be a narrative lesson for the PC’s growth ). (PC gains Aspect: Battle-Scarred Veteran
(Vol’dun) – reflecting their experience in the brutal clash, useful for intimidating foes or enduring
pain, but Shandris’s personal rapport grows more formal than friendly.) 
Act III – Night Warrior’s Path (branching narrative): Tyrande Whisperwind embarks on a
dangerous ritual to become the Night Warrior and avenge Teldrassil. Shandris, along with Maiev and
Sira Moonwarden, attempts to help Tyrande in Darkshore. The PC can be present (especially
if they are a Night Elf or were involved in Act I’s aftermath). Quest – “Nightfall”: As Tyrande
undergoes Elune’s Night Warrior ritual, Shandris and the PC fend off Horde interlopers and also
protect vulnerable participants. The PC faces a moral choice when Sira and Delaryn (night elf
sentinels) are killed and raised by Nathanos as undead right after Tyrande’s transformation. 
Choice: Chase Nathanos to try to put an end to him (vengeance), or stay and tend to the wounded
and secure Darkshore (duty). 
Vengeance Chase: The PC, perhaps fueled by rage, pursues Nathanos Blightcaller alongside
Shandris (in lore Tyrande went, but we can allow PC and Shandris if desired). They don’t catch him
(he escapes to later be confronted elsewhere), but they might slay one of his Val’kyr. Shandris herself,
though yearning to avenge her people, notes the futility of chasing a retreating enemy too far. This
path risks Sira and Delaryn’s bodies being taken because fewer Alliance stayed; those two become
undeath pawns (as in canon). Shandris is left saddened that two of her comrades are now in
Sylvanas’s thrall. (This could instigate an Aspect on Shandris: Haunted by the Lost which might come
into play as an NPC compel – her resolve for vengeance intensifies, possibly to her detriment.) The
PC doesn’t gain her full trust yet, as her mind is clouded by grief and revenge. 
Duty and Defense: If the PC convinces Shandris to secure their position instead of chasing
Nathanos, they save more lives in the aftermath. They perhaps retrieve Sira’s body or at least prevent
more casualties. Tyrande returns having slain one Val’kyr and is furious Sylvanas escaped, but the
Alliance holds Darkshore more firmly thanks to the PC’s level-headedness. Shandris, while agonized
at letting Nathanos go, recognizes the wisdom in the PC’s choice (much like Anduin counseled
patience). She softly thanks the PC for keeping her from “losing herself” to vengeance entirely. (Gain 
Aspect: Temper of the Moon – Shandris trusts the PC to help moderate the fiery Night Elf desire for
revenge with strategic calm. This could be invoked to calm raging allies or resist Provocation
attempts that prey on anger.) 
Act V – The Tide Turns in Nazjatar: When the seas part and both factions are lured into Nazjatar,
Shandris is among the Alliance leaders who survive their ships’ destruction. She works with the
PC and others to save Alliance sailors from naga clutches. Quest – “Undersea Allies”: In
Nazjatar’s strange depths, Shandris and the PC undertake missions to rally the Waveblade Ankoan
(a fish-like people). Shandris tasks the PC with slaying a Naga sorceress performing a ritual (the
PC does this in-game in Nazjatar with her guidance ). Choice: Focus on rescue ops (gather Alliance
survivors first, possibly including helping a wounded Genn Greymane or other VIP), or strike key
naga targets to cripple Azshara’s forces. 
Rescue First: Prioritizing survivors, the PC and Shandris comb the coral forests to free trapped
Alliance soldiers from kelp and shipwrecks. They even save an Ankoan warrior from a giant crab,
earning that warrior’s clan allegiance. This approach solidifies Alliance strength in Nazjatar. Shandris
expresses that “every soldier saved is a victory against Azshara.” (Gain Stunt: Allied Shell – once per
session, an Ankoan ally or saved Alliance marine can provide aid or absorb a hit for the PC, reflecting
the allies indebted to them.) •

Offensive Strike: Taking out the Naga tidemistress Ethendriss and destroying her power orbs
weakens the enemy. Fewer Alliance are saved initially, but the naga forces are thrown into disarray.
This may make the final push against Azshara easier (e.g., one less wave of naga in the big battle).
Shandris acknowledges the tactical benefit, though at personal cost if any named Alliance NPC
perished due to delayed rescue. She gives a curt nod: “Azshara’s lackeys won’t threaten anyone again,
thanks to you.” The PC gains Stunt: Slayer of the Depths – +2 when fighting servants of the Old Gods
or naga, earned by their decisive strikes. 
Finale – The Future of the Kaldorei: With Azshara defeated and Sylvanas gone, Shandris faces the
aftermath: her people have been decimated, Tyrande is consumed by the Night Warrior’s wrath (and
leaves for Shadowlands, potentially), and thousands of years of Kaldorei life are upended. In an
epilogue personal quest, “Feathers on the Wind”, Shandris meets the PC at the rebuilt
Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas or perhaps atop the new World Tree sapling if one is being
planted. She reflects on the balance between vengeance and healing. Here, if the PC had
consistently guided her toward rationality and mercy, Shandris will lean on their counsel to decide
the Kaldorei’s path (e.g. possibly advocating for the night elves to take a place in the Alliance
Council rather than isolating in grief). If the PC instead stoked her vengeance at every turn, Shandris
might decide to depart on a lone quest to hunt remaining Sylvanas loyalists or scour Azeroth for
signs of Sylvanas (in essence, a self-imposed exile of hunting). The PC’s influence can genuinely
change Shandris’s trajectory. 
Resolution (Trust Path): Shandris fully trusts the PC’s wisdom. In the “Alliance Council” epilogue
scene, she speaks up in favor of reconciliation and rebuilding, echoing lessons the PC imparted.
Example: she may cite that “even in the deepest night, one needs a glimmer of dawn” – a poetic line the
PC perhaps told her. The PC is honored publicly by Shandris before all leaders, hailed as Champion of
Teldrassil’s Remembrance or given a Moonwell Chalice (an artifact blessed by Elune, which serves as
an Extra Aspect for the PC: Elune’s Blessing – a free invoke available in any situation of protecting the
innocent or leading Kaldorei). 
Resolution (Vengeance Path): Shandris, while grateful for the PC’s help in war, is somewhat lost in
purpose. If Tyrande departed (possibly unresolved in her Night Warrior fury), Shandris might decide
to follow her or simply continue fighting shadows of the past. She thanks the PC for fighting at her
side, but there is a distance between them if the PC encouraged her darker impulses – Shandris
leaves, a wanderer seeking meaning in bloodshed, which could be a plot hook for future stories ( e.g.,
if a Shadowlands tie-in, Shandris might go to find Tyrande, etc.). In this outcome, the PC receives
recognition from others (perhaps Genn Greymane or Anduin thanks them for their service), but
Shandris does not give a personal gift or endorsement. The lack of her Aspect in the finale might
mean fewer elven archers answering the PC’s call in the climatic battle (a subtle mechanical
disadvantage). 
Rewards: Building a strong bond with Shandris yields Ancient Sentinel’s Longbow, a beautifully
crafted bow said to be a gift from Tyrande to Shandris centuries ago, now passed to the PC for their
deeds. (If the PC isn’t a bow user, it could be another Elven weapon or an inscribed Sentinel’s Cloak
for rogues.) This item conveys Stunt: Sentinel’s Marksmanship – the PC gains +2 to Shoot when
performing called shots or covering fire, thanks to techniques Shandris taught. Furthermore, the PC
gains Aspect: Blessing of Elune (if they earned Shandris’s full trust) – representing that Elune, through
Shandris’s prayers, watches over them. They might invoke this aspect to resist fear (the tranquil
confidence of the Moon) or to guide their intuition with a touch of lunar wisdom. If trust was lacking,
the PC might still get a generic reward from the Alliance war effort, but nothing so sacred. 
Romance: Shandris has dedicated millennia to duty and has no canonical romantic partner, making
a romance possible for a fitting PC. A potential romance would be tempered by the tragedies of BfA:
it might blossom slowly as the PC helps Shandris process loss. Shared nights in Nazjatar, gazing at• 35

strange stars; quiet moments honoring the fallen in Darkshore; these lay the groundwork. Shandris,
initially reserved and formal, may eventually allow the PC to see her vulnerability – perhaps
admitting how alone she felt as Tyrande’s adopted daughter living in her shadow, or the pain of
losing so many sisters-in-arms. If the PC offers steady support and respect, Shandris could develop
feelings. A key moment might be after Azshara’s defeat: Shandris finds the PC tending a gravely
wounded Alliance fighter and realizes their compassion matches their courage. She might gently
take the PC’s hand, the stoic mask giving way to gratitude and affection. Romance Arc Outcome:
The PC and Shandris share a tender scene beneath the boughs of a regrown moonwell tree where
Shandris, in a rare soft voice, asks if the PC will stay with her “to help rebuild what we’ve lost –
together.” She offers a token: Feathermoon Pendant, a small moonstone carving of an owl (symbol
of the Goddess). This signifies her love. The PC gains Aspect: Lover of the Night Warrior (or similarly, 
Shandris’s Devotion ). This can be invoked for strength when fighting back-to-back with Shandris or for
determination when the PC’s will falters (the thought of returning to Shandris spurs them on). It may
also grant narrative privileges – for instance, the normally private Shandris might be willing to sway
Tyrande or give the PC insight into Night Elf politics on their behalf. In the epilogue, a romanced
Shandris could be a driving force in healing the Night Elves’ spirit – perhaps the PC and she establish
a memorial in Azeroth for Teldrassil’s victims, symbolizing not just loss but a hope for the future,
hand in hand. 
Princess Talanji – Zandalari’s Promise
Act II – The Lost Princess: Talanji enters the story as a prisoner of the Alliance, captured en route to
seek aid for Zandalar. The Horde rescues her in the Battle for Stormwind scenario, with the PC likely
participating (if Horde). Quest – “Escape from the Stockades”: The PC aids First Arcanist Thalyssra
and Lady Liadrin in infiltrating Stormwind to break Talanji out of jail (this is the BfA pre-patch event).
They fight through SI:7 agents and navigate the canals. The climax is freeing Talanji and Prophet Zul
from the Stockades. 
Outcome: Assuming success (canon), Talanji is grateful, though proud – she formally thanks the PC
once safe aboard the stolen ship Sanctum of Bones. “The Horde has my loyalty for this rescue,” she
proclaims, looking to the PC as one of her saviors. (All Horde PCs gain Aspect: Ally of Zandalar at
campaign start, but especially if the PC distinguished themselves—say by defeating a pursuing
Proudmoore war mage or cleverly diverting attention—Talanji personally notes their name and
deeds.) If somehow the rescue had hiccups (the PC could choose to, say, pursue extra objectives like
looting the Stormwind treasury or freeing additional prisoners, risking alarms), Zul might get
wounded or some grunts die. Talanji might admonish the PC for recklessness, tempering her early
trust. Nonetheless, she escapes, setting stage for Zandalar. 
Act III – Homeland in Peril: Back in Zandalar, Talanji strives to unite her people and gain the Horde’s
official alliance. She asks the Horde PC (now honored as Honorary Zandalari perhaps) to help quell
internal threats. Quest – “Blood in the Sands of Nazmir”: Talanji leads an expedition into Nazmir to
stop the Blood Trolls and their Blood God G’huun cult. The PC accompanies her through swamps
teeming with blood magic. They perform rituals to gain favor of the loa (like summoning 
Bwonsamdi or rescuing Rezan ’s avatar). During these trials, the PC witnesses Talanji’s courage and
her fears: she voices concern that Zandalar could fall like her father fears, and she confesses her
distrust of Sylvanas’s motives (quietly, if PC is a close confidant). Choice: Encourage Talanji’s faith
in old traditions – rally the loa, trust the Horde’s strength – or encourage her innovation and
independence – to lead Zandalar on her terms, perhaps even defying Sylvanas if needed. •

Tradition Path: The PC reinforces Talanji’s reverence for the loa and the Horde. They accompany her
in an arduous rite at Zanchul: e.g., helping sacrifice a great beast to impress Rezan or negotiating
with Bwonsamdi for aid against the Blood Trolls. Talanji emerges with Loa blessings (Rezan’s golden
light, or Bwonsamdi’s protective charm) and a renewed trust that the old ways will protect her people. (PC gains Aspect: Favored by Rezan – a lingering boon from the Loa of Kings, providing courage
or a literal glowing aura in dire times. Mechanically, once during the Nazmir battles, the PC can
invoke this for a burst of strength or to turn aside a lethal blow, as if Rezan watches over them.)
Talanji’s trust in the PC deepens, seeing them as a wise advisor who honors Zandalari heritage. 
Modern Path: The PC suggests that Talanji might need to forge a new path—“Unlike her father’s
adherence to old pacts” —perhaps question Bwonsamdi’s deals or Sylvanas’s war. Talanji
considers this bold outlook. During the Blood Troll confrontation, instead of just calling loa, Talanji
inspires her people directly, rallying the Zandalari troops with a vision of a united future. The PC
helps by delivering rousing words or a clever tactic (e.g., using stolen Horde Azerite technology
against the blood trolls, demonstrating new ways). The Blood God’s avatar is defeated by a
combination of Horde firepower and Zandalari might, not just ancient magic. Talanji is impressed by
the results of thinking outside tradition. She remarks that the PC’s perspective “opens my eyes to
possibilities the Zandalari have long ignored.” (PC gains Stunt: Azerite Infusion – once, can add +2 to
a roll when using advanced tech or magical innovation in sync with old techniques – symbolizing
blending new and old knowledge, as Talanji learned from the PC.) Talanji’s bond with the PC becomes
one of mutual forward-thinking; she may confide doubts about Sylvanas if trust is high, setting seeds
for her later conflict with the Horde’s direction. 
Act IV – The Empire Strikes Back: The Alliance attacks Dazar’alor, killing King Rastakhan (Talanji’s
father). In the campaign, this is a pivotal tragedy for Talanji. Quest – “The Fall of the King”: If
the PC is Horde, they defend Dazar’alor alongside Talanji as Alliance forces storm the city. If Alliance,
they might witness Rastakhan’s end (perhaps even participate, creating dramatic irony in later
interactions with Talanji). During the battle’s climax, Rastakhan falls in combat against Alliance
champions. The PC sees Talanji rush to her dying father’s side. She lets out a wail of grief and fury
that echoes through the Great Seal. Sylvanas’s Horde, instead of saving Rastakhan, prioritizes
holding the line. This becomes a source of resentment for Talanji. After the dust settles, 
Princess Talanji becomes Queen Talanji, inheriting a throne amid chaos. The PC has a chance to
console or advise her. Choice: Support Talanji’s desire for vengeance (she wants retribution for her
father, possibly pushing her to demand the Horde retaliate more brutally), or counsel restraint and
alliance (urge her to honor Rastakhan’s wish of Zandalar joining the Horde strongly, not fracturing it
with blame). 
Vengeance Path: The PC, if hot-blooded (and perhaps if they too deeply hate the Alliance), fans the
flames. Talanji, in her mourning, agrees that only blood will answer blood. She orders an immediate
counter-attack. The PC leads a furious Zandalari strike on Alliance camps in Zuldazar, catching the
Alliance off-guard and inflicting damage (possibly even killing a minor Alliance NPC or burning their
ships). This un-canon action has consequences: it jeopardizes Horde-Alliance peace prospects and
starts to alienate Baine and Saurfang’s faction. Sylvanas, however, approves. She praises both Talanji
and the PC for their ruthlessness. (PC gains Aspect: Hero of the Zandalari Revenge – adored by
Zandalari who lust for vengeance; however, Alliance hatred for them intensifies, a double-edged
aspect.) Talanji’s trust in the PC as someone who stands with her unconditionally is cemented—
perhaps dangerously so, as she might later ask the PC to undertake reckless vengeance missions
(GM can weave in such side quests). 
Restraint Path: The PC holds Talanji back from rash action. Perhaps invoking Rastakhan’s more
diplomatic traits or the need to finish what he started – the alliance with the Horde. Talanji,
through tears, takes a breath and holds a royal funeral instead of seeking immediate bloodshed. The•

PC stands at her side during Rastakhan’s pyre ceremony. This act of patience and respect
strengthens her leadership in the eyes of other Horde leaders (Baine, Thrall, etc., who attend the
funeral in support). It also secretly pleases Bwonsamdi, who lurks, satisfied that a chaotic war (which
could yield him souls but break Zandalar) is avoided. (PC gains Aspect: Queen’s Counsel – Talanji
trusts the PC’s advice on matters of state; they effectively become an honorary advisor in the new
Zandalari court. Invoke this for diplomatic influence when dealing with Zandalari or Horde
leadership.) However, note that Talanji will still harbor a grudge against the Alliance and some Horde
negligence; the PC’s influence just tempers it into resolve instead of blind rage. 
Act V – Bargains Beyond Death: In the aftermath, Talanji must deal with Bwonsamdi, the loa of
Death, to whom Rastakhan had made a desperate pact (sacrificing many souls and binding their
bloodline). The shadows of Sylvanas’s actions and the Old God looming also pressure her. Quest
– “Death’s Due”: Bwonsamdi demands Talanji honor the debt: souls of Zandalar in exchange for
continued protection. Talanji balks, unwilling to pay such a price, but the blood troll threat and rising
undead in Nazmir make Bwonsamdi’s power crucial. She asks the PC to accompany her to
Bwonsamdi’s temple for negotiations. Choice: Assist Talanji in outsmarting the loa (perhaps finding
a loophole or an alternative bargain), or encourage submitting to the terms for the greater good
(upholding the deal to keep Zandalar safe a little longer). 
Outsmart the Loa: The PC recalls lore or uses clever wording to amend the deal. For instance, they
might offer that instead of random Zandalari souls, Bwonsamdi gets the souls of specifically the
blood trolls and any invaders who threaten Zandalar. This twists the pact to not sacrifice her people
unjustly. A challenging Deception or Lore roll might be required, with Bwonsamdi chuckling but
ultimately agreeing if phrased as fulfilling Rastakhan’s promise in spirit. Talanji is deeply relieved and
impressed by the PC’s wit. (Gain Aspect: Bwonsamdi’s “Favorite” – the loa has taken a liking to the PC’s
guile. This can be invoked once when dealing with undead or spirits; conversely, Bwonsamdi might
play tricks on the PC now and then as a compel, but benign ones. It’s a mixed blessing of a
relationship.) Talanji’s leadership is strengthened by freeing her from a terrible burden, thanks to the
PC. 
Honor the Pact: If the PC advises to stick to the letter of Rastakhan’s deal, Talanji sorrowfully
consents to Bwonsamdi’s demands – perhaps selecting condemned criminals or already dying
warriors to fulfill a quota of souls. This weighs heavily on her conscience (and the PC’s, possibly).
Bwonsamdi continues to watch over the crown, but Talanji’s trust in the PC may actually dip if she
feels they made her compromise her morals. Alternatively, if framed that there was no other choice,
she at least knows the PC will make hard calls for Zandalar’s survival. (PC gains Stunt: Deal with Death
– having bargained with Bwonsamdi, the PC gets +2 to Will against fear or intimidation by undead/
spirits, knowing first-hand that even death can be negotiated with. However, the moral stain might
manifest as an occasional compel – nightmares or a haunting regret for the lives bargained away.) 
Epilogue – Queen of the Empire: Queen Talanji’s personal quest culminates in whether Zandalar
stands proudly with the Horde or more aloof. In the epilogue Alliance-Horde armistice, Talanji
initially is furious that the Alliance got away with killing Rastakhan. There’s historical tension: she
nearly withdraws from the peace talks (in lore, the novel Shadows Rising shows Talanji feeling the
Horde didn’t avenge or protect her father). The PC can be pivotal here. If they have Talanji’s full trust
(and perhaps a close friendship or romance), they can persuade her to remain in the Horde Council
and sign the armistice, securing Zandalari’s future as part of Azeroth’s recovery. If their relationship
is weaker or adversarial (say the PC was Alliance who only interacted later, or a Horde who bungled
things), Talanji might isolate Zandalar, which could sow seeds for future conflict. 
Positive Outcome: Talanji stays in the Horde Alliance, guided in part by the PC’s counsel that 
“Zandalar is stronger with allies.” She declares before the Horde Council: “Zandalar forever stands, and
Zandalar stands with the Horde!” This moment, likely influenced by the PC’s earlier advice during her•

•

13

darkest times, cements a lasting alliance. The PC is hailed as a Friend of Zandalar at this assembly
(Baine even acknowledging them if present). The queen grants them a final reward: Zandalari
Direhorn (Mount) – the PC receives a royal-protected direhorn hatchling to raise, symbol of
Zandalari honor. (In Fate terms, this is a potent Asset – a large, tough mount that can be used in
challenges, maybe giving +2 to Physique when charging or an extra stress box to absorb damage for
its rider.) 
Negative/Neutral Outcome: If things went poorly, Talanji’s mistrust (of the Horde’s commitment or
the PC’s guidance) leads her to withdraw somewhat. Zandalar doesn’t secede outright, but Talanji
pointedly skips some joint meetings or demands reparations that cause strain. The PC might leave
Zandalar with a sense of unfinished business. (GM could use this as a springboard for a future
campaign or at least note the diplomatic unease. The PC might still get a token like a Zandalari
Insignia for their help, but it’s more ceremonial. The Aspect: Champion of Zandalar might only be
available if they really earned it.) 
Rewards: Champion’s Boon: If the PC achieved a strong bond with Talanji, they are granted the title 
“Honorary Zanchuli” – effectively part of her council of advisors. This comes with an Aspect:
Champion of the Golden Throne. It can be invoked for authority when dealing with Zandalari forces or
political weight in Horde matters (e.g., convincing a Horde general to heed a strategy by dropping
that the Queen backs the PC). Materially, Talanji may reward the PC with Dazar’alor Regalia,
splendid armor gilded in Zandalari gold, fit for a hero of the empire (functions as a suit of armor with
a free invoke for impression or intimidation due to its magnificence in social conflicts among
Zandalari). They also receive a personal Stunt: Loa’s Blessing – once per session, the PC can call on a
minor Loa spirit for aid (perhaps a burst of healing rain from Pa’ku or a shielding roar from Kimbul,
etc., effectively a one-time +2 or narrative boon). If the PC was on poor terms with Talanji, they might
only get a basic thanks or, if Alliance, an acknowledgment of honor (e.g., Anduin might give them a
medal for trying diplomacy with her). But the richest rewards clearly come from earning the young
Queen’s trust and friendship. 
Romance: Talanji is a proud, strong leader and single (no known consort). A romance is a high-
stakes, high-reward path. For a Horde PC of suitable charisma (or even an Alliance one in a star-
crossed way), winning Talanji’s heart involves proving one’s worth to her people and offering
personal understanding. Early signs might include Talanji confiding her burdens to the PC late at
night aboard the flagship, or the PC making a grand gesture like saving someone dear to her (for
example, rescuing Jolani, a fictional handmaiden or childhood friend of Talanji’s, from Alliance
captivity). Over time, Talanji might invite the PC to join her in private ceremonies – such as lighting
candles for her father in Atal’Dazar’s royal vault, a very intimate and sacred act. If the PC partakes
respectfully, it’s a bonding moment. The romance likely truly blossoms after Rastakhan’s death,
when the PC helps Talanji shoulder her grief. Perhaps one night in the Zandalari palace gardens,
under Zuldazar’s starlit sky, Talanji asks the PC to recount their home and experiences – she is
fascinated by their life beyond Zandalar. In that vulnerability, sparks fly. They might share a gentle
kiss by an ancient fountain as direhorn hatchlings coo in the distance. Romance Outcome: The PC
effectively becomes the Queen’s consort in all but name by campaign’s end. Talanji doesn’t announce
anything during wartime, but those close to her (like Rokhan or Nathanos if around) notice the
closeness. In the epilogue, if peace is achieved, Talanji invites the PC to stay in Zuldazar as an
ambassador … and by her side. A romanced Talanji gives the PC a ring engraved with the Zandalari
crest – not quite a marriage proposal officially, but in private it is. This grants Aspect: Beloved of the
Zandalari Queen. It functions like a super-powered version of Champion of Zandalar – almost no
Zandalari will dare disrespect the PC, and Alliance/Horde leaders treat them as a key connector to
Talanji. The personal bond can be invoked to inspire the PC to heroic deeds (e.g., “For Talanji!” as a
rallying cry granting +2 in a crucial moment). Narratively, this could even lead to the PC having to• 
•

consider leaving their original faction if different – but as the user suggests, “regardless of Horde or
Alliance”, love can bloom. It’s a very potent and politically significant romance, essentially uniting
factions through affection. 
Vereesa Windrunner – Silver Covenant’s Heart
Context: Vereesa, Ranger-General of the Silver Covenant, plays a quieter role in BfA but is deeply
tied to her sisters Alleria and Sylvanas. She’s an Alliance-aligned high elf leading a band of
rangers and hates what Sylvanas has become. Her personal quests involve family and faction –
navigating her loyalty to the Alliance and love for her sisters. 
Interlude – Three Sisters Reunion (Pre-War): Some months before the War of Thorns, Alleria and
Vereesa arrange a secret meeting with Sylvanas at their childhood home, Windrunner Spire. 
Quest – “Reunion at the Spire” (Optional flashback quest, Alliance or Neutral PC): Vereesa, unsure if
Sylvanas can be reasoned with, brings the PC as a hidden escort. The PC hides among the ruins as
the sisters meet for a tense picnic. Emotions are high: Sylvanas is eerily calm, Alleria is on guard,
Vereesa is yearning for a true reunion. Twist: Sylvanas planned an ambush – she brought Forsaken
assassins to surround Alleria and Vereesa. The PC senses the trap (perhaps via a successful
Notice roll or a whisper from Alleria’s void sensing). 
Outcome – Protect the Sisters: The PC springs from hiding in time to intercept poisoned arrows
aimed at Alleria and Vereesa. A fight erupts: Alleria unleashes void magic, Sylvanas calls in more
undead. The PC can engage Sylvanas briefly (though she’s far too powerful to defeat, holding back to
toy with her sisters). The goal is to cover Alleria and Vereesa’s escape. They flee, possibly with the PC
tossing a smoke bomb or collapsing a wall to cut off pursuers. In the chaos, Sylvanas nearly shoots
Vereesa in the back but hesitates (a flicker of old love, noted by PC perhaps). The trio (plus PC)
escapes into the woods. Aftermath: Vereesa is heartbroken but thankful. She remarks, “I almost
believed we could be a family again… thank you for saving us.” (PC gains Aspect: Witness to Windrunner
Truth – they have seen Sylvanas’s treachery and the sisters’ pain first-hand. This might give insight or
credibility when discussing Sylvanas or the Windrunner saga with others.) Vereesa’s trust in the PC
soars, as they literally saved her life and Alleria’s. 
If PC Fails or Isn’t There: Should the PC not intervene, Alleria’s void senses still alert them last-
minute, but the escape is messier. Vereesa is grazed by an arrow (wounded) and the emotional
wound of Sylvanas’s betrayal cuts deeper. Without the PC, the sisters fend for themselves with more
difficulty. No PC involvement means no earned trust here – Vereesa later might mention this tragedy
as context to the PC. (It’s recommended this quest be a backstory event to set the tone; the GM can
narrate it if the PC wasn’t present. If PC is Horde, they wouldn’t be there, but might hear rumors of it
later.) 
Act IV – The Battle for Orgrimmar (Alliance perspective, Alternate Scenario): In the culmination
of the war, if the GM runs the Alliance raid on Orgrimmar (as a parallel to the events at Dazar’alor), Vereesa leads an Alliance strike team from Razor Hill into Orgrimmar’s rear gates. Quest –
“Siege from the Shadows”: The PC (Alliance) joins Vereesa’s covert ops group. Goals: sabotage
Orgrimmar’s goblin artillery to prevent a counterattack during the Alliance assault on Dazar’alor, and
possibly secure important intel or prisoners. The PC and Vereesa scale the cliffs of Orgrimmar at
night, sneak through the Drag, and clash with Horde defenders in the shadows. 
Outcome – Mission Success: The duo successfully plants explosives on the goblin Shredder tanks
and quietly neutralizes a communication tower. At one point, they might face a formidable foe – say,
a Kor’kron veteran or a dark ranger captain left in Orgrimmar. Vereesa’s precise arrows and the PC’s
skills win the day. They withdraw as planned, hearing later that their efforts prevented heavy•

casualties in the concurrent Battle of Dazar’alor (this ties into the idea that the Horde couldn’t mount
a quick revenge strike thanks to their work). Vereesa is impressed with the PC’s competence. “You
move with the swiftness of a Farstrider,” she praises. (PC gains Stunt: Urban Ranger – +2 to Athletics or
Stealth in city environments, knowledge picked up from Vereesa about moving through cities like
forests.) 
Partial/Failure: If something goes wrong (e.g., alarm triggered too early), the PC might have to
choose between completing the sabotage or ensuring Vereesa’s safety. A heroic PC will prioritize
getting Vereesa out if overwhelmed; a mission-focused one might blow up the targets but Vereesa
gets injured. Depending on choice: save Vereesa (she survives thanks to PC but some objectives fail,
meaning Alliance fleet faces a bit more fire; Vereesa is grateful on a personal level), or complete
mission (Alliance benefits, but Vereesa is wounded by an explosion or captured briefly until PC frees
her later – she appreciates the mission success but has a scar and a reminder of risk). These nuances
will affect her trust and the tone of their relationship (save her -> personal bond; prioritize mission ->
professional respect but maybe a cooler personal relation). 
Act V – Ending Sylvanas’s Reign: In the final confrontation at Orgrimmar’s gates, Vereesa stands
with Alleria and the Alliance during Saurfang’s Mak’gora. Notably, just before Saurfang challenges
Sylvanas, Alleria and Vereesa approach Anduin and Varok with a controversial thought: that
Sylvanas’s army might be needed for N’Zoth, suggesting staying their hand. Anduin rebuffs this,
and the battle proceeds. The PC can witness this debate or even weigh in (if present as an
Alliance champion). Quest – “The Last Choice”: As Sylvanas calls the Horde “nothing” and kills
Saurfang, chaos erupts. Vereesa draws her bow, ready to rain arrows if Sylvanas refuses to yield.
Sylvanas instead flees. Here the PC has a final choice if they have the means (perhaps a special
ranged weapon or spell): attempt to stop Sylvanas from escaping (a futile but character-defining
gesture), or hold Vereesa back from a desperate chase. 
Attempt the Shot: The PC and possibly Vereesa let loose volleys at the retreating Banshee. It’s
nearly impossible to stop her – Sylvanas shatters any projectiles with dark magic as she opens a
portal. But the symbolism matters. Vereesa whispers “Be at peace, Varok” as Sylvanas vanishes –
indicating her acceptance that this chapter closes without immediate revenge. She sees the PC
standing with her, bow in hand, and offers a solemn nod of kinship. (No mechanical effect on
Sylvanas – she’s gone – but PC gains Aspect: Tried to Avenge Saurfang. It reflects their dedication to
justice; Horde characters might respect them for it too post-war. Also, Vereesa’s personal regard for
them as someone who, like her, doesn’t let family or allies be struck down without answer.) 
Restrain Vereesa: If the PC gently stops Vereesa from running after Sylvanas (perhaps grabbing her
arm and saying it’s over), she initially flashes anger but then relents, the adrenaline fading. “You’re
right… another day,” she murmurs, lowering her bow. She is physically safe, and perhaps it’s the wiser
move as N’Zoth’s threat looms. Vereesa later thanks the PC for keeping her from a rash pursuit –
Sylvanas would have likely killed her if cornered. This cements a trust where Vereesa realizes the PC
truly has her well-being at heart. 
Epilogue: With Sylvanas gone and the war over, Vereesa participates in peace negotiations and likely
the forming of the Alliance-Horde armistice. If the PC is Alliance, Vereesa might invite them to join
the Silver Covenant celebration in Dalaran – raising a toast to lost heroes and new beginnings. If the
PC is Horde (and not a hated enemy), circumstances for bonding are rarer but perhaps through
Alleria’s void war or joint efforts against N’Zoth, they earned respect. Vereesa could acknowledge
them as “one of the honorable ones.” In any case, her future is focused on protecting Azeroth from
looming threats (like N’Zoth’s minions) and ensuring her fallen loved ones (like her husband Rhonin)
are honored. The PC may be a part of that – for example, she might ask for their help returning
Rhonin’s journal to their sons, a touching side task. •

Rewards: Vereesa bestows gifts of the High Elves to those she trusts. One reward is Thas’dorah’s
Shard – an arrowhead gem cut from the same bow Alleria once carried, now set in a pendant. It
carries the legacy of the Windrunner archery. (Mechanically, Stunt: Windrunner’s Aim – once per
session, the PC can auto-succeed at a difficult archery or ranged trick shot if it’s remotely plausible,
or gain +2 for a normal one. This represents guidance from Vereesa’s training and the Windrunner
technique.) Additionally, the PC gains Aspect: Silver Covenant Ally – the elite High Elf rangers consider
the PC one of their own. They can call on ranger support or access the Silver Enclave in Dalaran
freely. If the PC is ever in trouble in Alliance territory, a blue and silver cloaked figure might appear
to assist – a nice narrative backup. Should the PC have been on middling terms, Vereesa at least gifts
a enchanted quiver or blade with the Silver Covenant insignia, a sign of respect (it might just confer
a mild bonus like never running out of arrows or a +1 to Fight vs undead, etc.). 
Romance: Vereesa is a widow (her husband Rhonin fell in Theramore’s bombing). By BfA, some years
have passed, and while she still mourns, her heart could potentially open again. A PC who is
compassionate, patient, and valorous might kindle feelings in Vereesa. It would likely be an Alliance
PC (or a neutral mercenary) given faction alignment. The relationship would revolve around 
empathy and healing: the PC perhaps helps Vereesa remember the joy of life beyond loss. They
might bond over archery practice in Quel’Thalas’s autumn woods or evenings in the Silver Covenant’s
Lunarfall outpost sharing war stories. Vereesa would test the PC’s character subtly – integrity and
respect mean everything to her. When the PC honors the memory of the fallen or shows kindness to
her half-elf children (if they ever meet), that could deeply move her. A pinnacle moment might be
during the N’Zoth campaign: after a harrowing battle, the PC, wounded, is tended by Vereesa. She
stays by their bedside in Boralus, and as they wake, she impulsively kisses them, emotions laid bare
after nearly losing them. Romance Outcome: Vereesa allows herself to love again. She invites the
PC to visit the tranquil lodge of the Silver Covenant – possibly even introducing them to her twin
sons at some point, a huge step for a protective mother. The PC gains Aspect: Sunstrider’s Devotion
(though Vereesa is Windrunner, the High Elves of Silver Covenant often reference Sunwell or
Sunstrider lineage). This aspect symbolizes the rare union of a High Elf’s heart with another – it can
be invoked for unwavering resolve or clarity (like the warmth of the Sunwell guiding them). In terms
of narrative, if the PC is of another race, it shows how far Vereesa has come in trust (she once
distrusted non-high elves in Dalaran, purging the Sunreavers). Now she’s in love with someone
possibly outside her own people, breaking old barriers. This could even thaw tensions: for instance,
if the PC is a blood elf who defected, it’s almost a microcosm of Alliance-Horde reconciliation in
personal form. A romantic epilogue might have Vereesa and the PC standing on the rebuilt walls of
Theramore at sunset, Vereesa saying she has found hope and love again thanks to the PC. Perhaps
she gives them a new Windrunner locket with both their initials entwined – a new legacy to carry
forward. 
Sources: Warcraft lore and BfA campaign materials were used to ensure accuracy. Key events and character
motivations (Tess’s worgen heritage quest, Alleria’s void empowerment, Baine’s defiance over Derek
Proudmoore, Shandris’s war leadership, Talanji’s ascension and fears, Vereesa and Alleria’s
role at Orgrimmar, etc.) are drawn from official sources to ground these personal quests in WoW’s lore.
Each NPC’s quests were interwoven with the Battle for Azeroth narrative, providing branching outcomes
(trust vs. betrayal) and rich rewards consistent with a Fate Core campaign, as per the guidelines. The
romance options presented adhere to lore where possible (avoiding taken characters and building on
plausible affections). This expanded Personal Quest Catalogue is designed to seamlessly integrate into the
BFA campaign acts, adding depth and player agency to interactions with these pivotal characters. •
