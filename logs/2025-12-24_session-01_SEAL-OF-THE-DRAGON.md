# Chapter 1: Sealing Our Fate

The fog over Ashenvale did not feel like weather. It felt like intent—old, damp, and listening. Under boughs that had watched empires rise and rot, a new name moved with the patrol: **Suroe Dragonseal**, Sin’dorei, eyes lit with fel-green rumor and a discipline that did not match his smile.

The ambush was set with the Kaldorei’s usual competence—tripwires like spider-silk, firing lanes carved into the forest’s anatomy, a canopy platform prepared for sudden violence. For a heartbeat the world narrowed to one sound: a branch snap high-left, too measured to be accident. Suroe tasted the air and found the sour-sweet sting of spellwork—arcane ozone clinging to leaf and bark. The old hunger in his blood lifted its head like an animal.

He did not feed it.

He breathed.

The breath that left him carried green mist in thin wisps, visible in the foglight like a secret escaping. It was not a spell so much as a stance—control made physical. Suroe took point and signaled his squad without words: all around you. He read the ambush the way a veteran reads a battlefield—by absence, by pressure, by where silence gathers.

When the first volley came, it was meant to shear the front rank and break the center. Instead, the arrow meant for Suroe missed by a humiliating margin. He moved only an inch, and that inch was an insult. The squad saw it and steadied. Morale—usually so fragile under surprise—tightened into something like faith.

Suroe answered with speed that belonged to legends and rooftop thieves. He rose into the canopy as if the tree had offered him a staircase: branch to trunk to foliage-burst, a comet of controlled violence wreathed in seafoam chi. He landed on the platform with a stamp that made the wood groan, greeted the marksman with the polite cadence of a duelist, and then erased the distance between “greeting” and “farewell.”

His Flurry of Blows was not a single strike but a sentence spoken in rapid syllables—palm, elbow, sweep, and a twist of balance so precise the marksman’s courage became gravity. The archer went down into leaves and shadow, taken out of the fight with a fall that would bruise more than the body. The skirmisher up there tried to answer with steel and found only mist, breath, and humiliation.

The forest retaliated from below. A hidden shooter—wiser than the one who fell—took the shot that punishes confidence. The arrow should have found skin. It did not. Suroe’s footing, his angle, and the fog itself conspired in his favor; he pivoted and the strike bit bark instead. Even then, he did not chase the thrill. He watched. He learned. He carved openings.

The skirmisher, already off-balance, became a weapon in Suroe’s hands.

He closed with a sudden shift of hips and a practiced breach of guard—a throw that looked like a joke until it wasn’t. “Timber,” he called, voice all games and no mercy, and the Kaldorei flew. The body crashed into a root-hollow where the true shooter hid, turning concealment into chaos. The lane was burned. The enemy was revealed.

Suroe dropped again—this time into the root-hollow like a verdict. He landed between enemies to split their unity and force them to fight him on uneven footing. The revealed archer folded under a palm strike that stole breath and pride at once. Another sentinel, a bladesinger adept, proved tougher—good enough to survive the flurry but not unscathed. The fight left them marked: cracked bone, shaken rhythm, and the unmistakable understanding that they were no longer dictating the exchange.

When steel finally cut for Suroe in earnest, the monk’s answer came as **Breath of Yu’lon**—a coiling mist that made strikes fail ugly, turning clean attacks into coughing misses. He moved like weather. He fought like a lesson.

And then Suroe showed the most frightening kind of restraint: he could have ended the bladesinger. Instead, he chose control. His hand—blue with devouring chi—found the throat not to crush, but to interrupt the body’s cadence and the mind’s channel. The enemy’s casting stuttered. Their breath became unreliable. In that moment, power was not violence—it was denial.

A final truth landed hard: the Kaldorei weren’t done. Somewhere out in the fog, another angle shifted. Another lane prepared itself. The forest kept offering targets, and Suroe kept choosing not to become the thing his blood wanted him to be.

Later, when the adrenaline thinned, the scribes of memory returned to older wars. Suroe’s name—**Dragonseal**—was not merely a surname but a vow hammered into history.

Once, his house had been **Dragonsun**, proud and beloved, bearer of the runic amulet **Dracon’o Belore**. Once, **Ama’thar Dragonsun** had wielded blade and anti-magic with peerless certainty and convinced himself the gift made him a master. The curse that followed was not fire or frost; it was hunger—mana-craving that never ended—and the emblazoned seal **Dracon’Thor’reth**, flaring into bestial strength when denied and making the bloodline dangerous to keep too near the Sunwell’s glow.

It was **Lady Chasiel** who dragged the family back from the brink—binding the dragon rather than riding it, renouncing the arrogance of the old name, and sealing the relic away beneath ward and shame. In that act, Dragonsun became Dragonseal. Not forgiven. Not forgotten. Repurposed: a military house with redemption measured in duty, not applause.

Suroe, four centuries into that inheritance, is the mirror image of Ama’thar in all the ways that matter—and the opposite in the one way that saves lives. Where Ama’thar believed his myth, Suroe hears it and distrusts it. Where Ama’thar fed the dragon, Suroe learned—through streets, war, and the sharp mercy of Taran’Zhu—to name what is wrong with him and live anyway.

In Ashenvale’s fog, the seal did not win.

The choice did.
