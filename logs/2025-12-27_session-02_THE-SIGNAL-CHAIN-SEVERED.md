# Chapter 2: Sealing Our Fate - Part Two

Ashenvale’s night did not greet the Sin’dorei with stars. It greeted them with fog—low, patient, and listening—clinging to bark and boot-leather as if the forest meant to remember every trespass by touch. The road ahead lay too straight, too clean, too convenient: a lane carved by habit and violence, a place where arrows preferred to speak in chorus.

Suroe Dragonseal refused to whisper.

He descended from the canopy like a dare made flesh, landing with the poised contempt of a warrior who had already decided the woods would not own him. He called the unseen Sentinels out by name only in spirit—mocking the brush, the silence, the myth of Kaldorei terror—then moved as if the lane were not a trap but a stage. Seafoam-green mist trailed his momentum; crimson chi answered his blood like a furnace taking air.

The ambush revealed itself in fragments: a glint of crescent steel, a breath in Darnassian, a shadow withdrawing to carry warning. The Kaldorei fought the way forests fight—by geometry, by patience, by angles—and for a moment it seemed they meant to keep him pinned where the lane could finish what their hands began.

They never got the chance.

Suroe bridged the distance with Sha’do-Pan speed, turning trunk and branch into a staircase. He struck from above in a blur of palms and knees, the rhythm brutal and exact, dropping Sentinels in tight, efficient bursts—wind stolen, weapons scattered, bodies driven into bark and leaf-litter. Two fell hard enough to stop being threats. A third tried to withdraw. Suroe chased like a verdict. Chi flared. A sweeping kick ended the runner’s retreat in the mud and mist.

It was then the forest chose to answer the insult.

A cold lunar brand—small, precise—caught him as a consequence not of failure, but of presence. The Kaldorei did not need prisoners to bargain, only time and a coordinate. Yet when the moment arrived to turn that mark into a noose, Suroe did something both disciplined and costly: he accepted the truth of the forest’s advantage and burned it off anyway. The purging was a controlled violence; it left his mind strained, a thin ache behind the eyes, but it robbed the Sentinels of their cleanest line on him.

Still, the woods tightened. Voices spoke in low Common from hiding, calm and razor-edged. A Captain emerged in slivers—silver hair, moonsteel accents, bow and blade carried with the confidence of someone used to commanding fights that ended on her terms. She offered terms as if she still held the center of the board. Suroe answered with laughter, and the laughter became motion.

He went to her in the canopy, fist first, and the negotiation died there.

The duel on swaying limbs was brief and ugly. The Captain’s guard met him and shattered in stages—shoulder wrenched, breath cracked, footing stolen—yet she held with that infuriating Kaldorei discipline that makes defeat look like a choice. Sentinels crashed in to support her. Suroe met them with the same merciless economy he’d shown on the road: parries that became counters, counters that became takedowns, bodies folding where his palms found throat and jaw. His unit, no longer lingering in confused fear, obeyed with sharp competence: prisoners bound and dragged back, snipers set in adjacent canopies, overwatch angles claimed without fuss.

Then Suroe struck at the forest’s true weapon.

A relay runner carried a moon-sigil—small magic meant to stitch voices into a net. Suroe somersaulted through the gap between foes and drove a crimson-chi palm into the charm. Thunder warbled through the air. The sigil did not simply break; it unthreaded. Coordination faltered. The woods hesitated—bowstrings drawn but not loosed, footsteps stopping and starting wrong. In war, hesitation is blood.

Sentinel B lunged in desperation, spearpoint seeking to redeem the moment. Suroe became water. Flow met force; force was redirected. He guided the spear’s hungry line away from his own body and into the Captain’s leg—crippling without killing, a mercy shaped like cruelty. The Captain went down inches, breath stealing itself, while Suroe’s fist finished Sentinel B with a clean blow that snapped the man’s lights out.

In that suspended second—relay broken, command wounded, the lane littered with fallen and bound—Suroe offered his final terms not as a plea, but as a fact.

He reminded the Captain that he had tried the clean path first. That she had chosen pride over salvage, stubbornness over exchange. And now, with her shoulder ruined and her thigh gored, with officers blinking in the fog and soldiers reassessing their own mortality, he demanded surrender: her, and any officer close enough to be taken—so the rest might leave.

Ashenvale held its breath.

The Captain’s reply came like swallowing glass. She conceded the immediate engagement, not as a rout, but as disciplined withdrawal—her people permitted to carry their wounded into the fog, the ring loosening rather than sealing. Two officers emerged, weapons lowered, hands visible, submitting to custody with eyes full of hate and something colder: memory.

Below, Suroe’s Sergeant—white-knuckled a minute ago—finally found oxygen again and urged extraction with the urgency of someone who understood what taking officers meant. The Kaldorei withdrew, not broken, but marked by the humiliation of losing leadership in their own house.

Suroe Dragonseal stood in the listening fog with crimson mist curling off his skin like steam off heated steel, prisoners bound at his command, and Ashenvale recalculating around him—quietly, professionally—already deciding what the forest would demand in return.
