# Session 03 — BREATH OF KARMA (2025-12-27)

Ashenvale did not feel like a forest that day. It felt like a throat.

Mist hung low and listening, swallowing distance and softening sound until every footfall seemed like a confession. Suroe Dragonseal perched above the lane like a patient flaw in reality—disciplined posture, disciplined breath, the kind of quiet that usually precedes restraint. Yet beneath the monk’s harness, Dracon’Thor’reth simmered like an ember denied air for too long.

The Kaldorei came the way they always come: careful, methodical, with the belief that the forest belongs to them and therefore will behave. A Shadowblade slid through brush with professional grace, supported by Sentinels and druids who moved like they expected the world to make room for their oaths. They believed the rescue raid was a matter of extraction and punishment.

They did not account for hunger.

Suroe did not open with a roar. He opened with craft. Crimson chi gathered between his palms, compressed into disruptive pressure—then released in a rolling sequence of “poofing” clouds that detonated across the field like misdirection made physical. The effect was not purely concealment; it was a distortion of instinct. For a blink, each Kaldorei unit felt the same flicker of wrongness in the spine, the sense that something had stepped behind them without sound.

That blink was all his unit needed.

Sin’dorei bodies dropped from canopy with Shado-Pan silence, the opening strikes surgical and humiliating: a palm-heel into ribs that echoed through bone like thunder under skin, a spear parried into empty air, a throat struck to steal breath, a leg swept to take balance and confidence at the same time. In the red haze, Suroe moved with feral elegance—discipline perverted into predation.

The Shadowblade ran. Suroe pursued.

He gained on her in the fog, closing distance before she could vanish into kill lanes, and when he caught her the moment turned ugly. A hand clamped her by the neck like a tag in a child’s game—delivered with humor that wasn’t humor. His touch carried the cold mechanics of negative karma, siphoning vitality with clinical disrespect.

Then the Seal answered.

A shimmer ignited beneath his tunic, sudden and violent—an outpouring of power into long-untapped reservoirs. Suroe’s breath hitched; his eyes flared with fel-tainted brightness threaded through crimson chi. The Dragonseal hunger surged from quiet ember to ravenous mandate. In that moment, the line between monk and monster blurred hard enough to cut.

The raid tightened, attempting to overwhelm him with numbers and formation. They brought a battalion’s intent into a space where intent could be eaten. Suroe’s voice layered, echoing like it belonged to something older than sin’dorei pride, and he laughed like the land itself was a joke.

“Bala’dash, tankards…” he mocked, a crimson toast before the seal broke loose.

What followed was not a spell in the usual sense. It was a release.

Breath of Karma poured from him in a boiling wave of crimson mist that rolled over Ashenvale like a storm front. It didn’t simply suffocate; it turned mana reservoirs into liabilities—overheating, inflaming, burning the very channels the druids relied on. The fog felt acidic against their craft. Kaldorei faltered mid-cast, hands trembling, wards collapsing into useless geometry. Some fell prone immediately, wailing as their own power turned against them.

Suroe stood in the aftermath like a weapon that had remembered why it was forged.

The rescue party broke—shattered into scattered motion: those who could run did, those who couldn’t crawled, and those who tried to hold formation found themselves holding air. The forest did not cheer. It only watched, as if deciding whether this was war… or blasphemy.

When the crimson haze thinned enough to see again, the cost was obvious: bodies on the ground, wounded pride in the trees, and a story already forming in the mouths of survivors. The Kaldorei would not call him “monk” after this.

They would call him what the act made him.

And somewhere beneath the seal’s glow, Suroe Dragonseal would eventually have to face the quiet question that always arrives after power is used like a blunt instrument:

What did I just become?
