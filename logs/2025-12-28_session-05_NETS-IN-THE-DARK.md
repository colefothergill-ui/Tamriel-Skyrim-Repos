# Session 05 — NETS IN THE DARK (2025-12-28)

Ashenvale did not reward victory with silence. It rewarded it with attention.

Suroe Dragonseal came out of the Moonlane aftermath like a man waking from a fever—blood on leaves, breath tight in his ribs, the Dragon Seal’s echo still laughing somewhere behind his eyes. The battlefield was a smear of crimson fog and broken geometry: wards that had tried to hold the lane snapping apart like thread, and sentinels who had found out—too late—that “discipline” did not always beat “force.”

The Wardens did not arrive with rage. They arrived with procedure.

Captain Aethrya Moonshadow’s voice cut through the thinning mist like a blade made of law. Her people had already re-formed their spacing, already shifted to sound-tracking and net angles, already trying to turn the forest into a cage. She called Suroe by name. She called out the Moonsteel Crescent. She called it theft.

Suroe answered with a warning.

When the binding-lattice rose—clean lines of arcanic intent meant to lock joints, deny footwork, and punish motion—Suroe sheared it in half. The crescent-wave tore forward low to the ground, earth upheaving in its path, and the kill-lane’s elegance died in a single, contemptuous cut. Mist flooded the space again, not as cover, but as statement.

Serpent Stance followed: not a posture of hesitation, but of predation. While the Wardens tried to “track by sound,” Suroe read their gaps by muscle tension and spacing—the micro-errors that form when a formation is forced to think faster than it can breathe. His flurry struck like a lesson written in bruises. Two sentinels fell. Aethrya survived only by will and withdrawal, her discipline cracking under the weight of sudden violence.

The counter-volley came anyway—blind arrows, loosed into fog and sound. Serpent Stance turned them into near-misses, one cutting shallow across Suroe’s cheek. The blood there was small, but it was real, and Suroe promised repayment with the calm certainty of someone who fully intends to keep receipts.

Then the canopy became his road.

Sha’do-Pan Parkour carried him two zones in a breath—roots, branches, and trunk-lines becoming a silent highway. He reappeared ahead of the retreat, above it, and dropped into their path like a verdict. His Seal answered the moment with a crimson flare that lit his forearms and woke the Thalassian inscriptions on the stolen moonsteel.

He offered surrender once.

Aethrya tried to buy time with a ward-charm. Suroe turned it into a flare.

Wardfire and red chi clung to her cloak and hands, outlining her in sputtering rune-sparks: Glowing Ward-Residue, impossible to hide and worse to deny. With the commander marked and reeling, Suroe pressed terms at blade-point and voice-point, forcing an ordered withdrawal from the immediate line. Bowstrings slackened. The forest listened.

And then Suroe chose captives.

He withdrew the crescent from her throat, apologized like a man tired of his own anger, and knocked Captain Moonshadow unconscious with a decisive kick. He seized a bound druid elder in the same motion—living-root cord still tightening at every panicked breath—and vanished backward into the trees with both bodies secured.

Ashenvale did not forget that.

The lane to Darkshore remained open—ambush points collapsed, scouts removed, and now proof of victory carried on Suroe’s shoulder. But the cost was obvious in the way the forest shifted its weight: this was no longer “counter-scouting.” This was the beginning of a Hunt.

Nets in the dark. Owls overhead. Bind-mages whispering angles into the leaves.

And somewhere deeper, older wood began to creak awake—slowly enough to be terrifying.

The road was clear.

The consequences were not.
