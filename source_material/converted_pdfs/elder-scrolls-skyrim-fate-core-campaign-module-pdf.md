Elder Scrolls: Skyrim – Fate Core Campaign Module
“Sons of Skyrim, the hour of war is at hand…”
Introduction: The World on Edge After Alduin’s Fall
Skyrim stands at a crossroads of fate in the turbulent aftermath of the dragon Alduin’s defeat. The
Dragonborn hero has vanished to parts unknown (rumored to be in Solstheim), leaving a mortal world to
settle its own flames . In his absence, the civil war between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak
Rebellion reignites with fury. The province of Skyrim – especially the rugged province of Skyrim (with our
focus on the hold of Skyrim in this campaign) – is a land of harsh beauty and harsher choices , where
Nords, Imperials, and other peoples now clash over the very soul of the nation. 
This campaign module is designed for Fate Core , emphasizing narrative-driven, cinematic play with rich
character drama. Players take on the roles of heroes swept up in Skyrim’s civil war in 4E 201 , shortly after
Alduin’s fall. The Dragonborn will not save the day – instead, the fate of Skyrim may hinge on the player
characters (PCs) . They are not the Dragonborn, but soldiers, mages, mercenaries, or wanderers whose
choices and ideals will shape the war’s course. 
Faction Perspectives: The campaign accommodates three perspectives :
- Stormcloak Rebellion: Nord patriots and allies fighting for Skyrim’s independence, Talos worship, and
Nordic traditions under Ulfric Stormcloak .
- Imperial Legion: Loyalists striving to preserve the Empire’s unity and Skyrim’s stability under General
Tullius and Jarl Elisif .
- Neutral Skyrim Factions: Characters working for a native faction such as the Companions , College of
Winterhold , Dark Brotherhood , or others. These PCs are not officially aligned with either army, but their
adventures entwine with the war’s events. They might act as mediators, spies, or free agents pursuing their
own agendas amid the conflict. 
Setting – Skyrim at War: The war is at a bloody stalemate as we begin. The Empire holds the western and
southern holds (Haafingar , Falkreath, Hjaalmarch, the Reach), while Stormcloaks control the east and north
(Eastmarch, the Pale, the Rift, Winterhold) . Whiterun Hold lies in the center as a critical neutral territory
– but not for long . Each hold’s capital city becomes a focal point of conflict or intrigue in the campaign,
from the ancient stone city of Windhelm to the highland market of Markarth . Every city has its own local
history, power players, and unrest which the war will inflame. GMs are provided detailed profiles for each
hold capital – its geography, key NPCs and factions, and unique quests or troubles – ensuring you have
material to bring these locations to life. 
Themes: This campaign explores identity, ideology, tragedy, patriotism, and moral conflict against the
backdrop of war . Nords struggle with what it means to be a “true son/daughter of Skyrim,” while others
weigh duty to Empire vs. loyalty to home. The tragedy of civil war touches every storyline: friends and
families divided, cities in flames, and the looming shadow of the Aldmeri Thalmor exploiting the chaos.
Patriotism inspires acts of heroism and sacrifice, yet blind nationalism or imperialism can lead to cruel12

choices. PCs will face moral dilemmas at every turn – whether to spare enemies, how to protect civilians,
whether ends justify means – with no easy answers . 
Fate Core Approach: We encourage a cinematic style where rules support the story. Scenes will often be
framed as Challenges or Conflicts with environmental Aspects for players to invoke. Fate Points flow
readily for dramatic storytelling – GMs should compel the PCs’ ideals and troubles to heighten tension.
Stress tracks, Consequences, and Clocks are used to model the grind of war: protracted battles and plots
may have “countdown clocks” of discrete steps to victory or disaster , so players see time running out. For
example, a major siege might be run with a six-segment clock (countdown) for the city’s walls being
breached or a ritual completed, ticking down as rounds pass or as certain triggers occur . When PCs
take bold action, they reduce the enemy’s clock or advance their own. Likewise, Consequences in battle will
represent lasting wounds or trauma – a soldier might suffer a Severe Consequence “Crushed Leg” after a
battering ram strike, which affects future scenes. Use these mechanics to reinforce the gritty stakes of war . 
Tone: The tone balances epic war drama with personal stories. Expect stirring battle scenes – clashing
shields on the Whiterun plains, dragon roars over Windhelm’s walls – but also quiet moments of
camaraderie in a tavern or a mourning scene in Falkreath’s graveyard. As GM, reward heroic sacrifices: if a
PC stays behind to hold a gate, maybe grant an extra Fate Point and narrate their legend sung by bards. But
also let the darkness of war show: comrades will fall, and even victories have costs. NPCs will exhibit
conflicting loyalties and hidden pains. By the end, the players should feel the weight of what it means to
fight for Skyrim’s future. 
Key Themes and Motifs (GM Guidance)
War and Loss: Every victory is bittersweet. Show the toll of war – burning villages, jarls grieving
fallen housecarls. When a beloved NPC dies heroically, give the party a moment of silence and
perhaps a Boost aspect like “ Emboldened by Sacrifice ” to use in retribution. PCs may earn Fate
Points for choosing to suffer to save others (a classic compel on their heroic aspects). 
Identity & Ideology: Play up the cultural clash. Stormcloak characters shout “Skyrim belongs to the
Nords!” while Dunmer refugees in Windhelm whisper their fears. An Imperial PC proud of the
Empire’s law might clash with a Nord PC who reveres Talos above all. These ideological differences
can be compelled: e.g., compel a Nord’s aspect “Son of Skyrim, Son of Talos” to make them resist
an Imperial diplomat’s order , creating dramatic social conflict. 
Moral Ambiguity: Few decisions are purely good or evil. Perhaps the Stormcloaks plan to sabotage
an Imperial supply train – but it’s full of medicine for a plague in Imperial-occupied Markarth. Do the
PCs allow innocents to suffer to win a tactical edge? These dilemmas can be represented
mechanically by offering a Fate Point for one choice (a compel of a principle) or the other , forcing the
players’ values into the spotlight. 
Unseen Manipulators: Foreshadow the Thalmor involvement subtly. In Act I-II, drop hints of a
hidden hand: a Stormcloak scout remarks, “Strange how the Thalmor always seem one step ahead,”
or an Imperial officer finds evidence of elven poison in a murdered Jarl’s mead. The Thalmor
represent a secret antagonist force sowing chaos . Use Countdown clocks for their schemes
– for example, a “Thalmor Influence” clock ticks up each time the war intensifies or a city’s side plot
goes unresolved. In the final Act, this clock reaches completion, revealing the full scope of their plan. 
Camaraderie and Tragedy: Amid bloodshed, allow moments of human connection. A quiet night in 
Windpeak Inn at Dawnstar , where soldiers of both sides separately nurse nightmares, could turn
into an impromptu calm where a PC leads a prayer to Mara for all the fallen – forging a temporary910

peace. Such an interlude might remove a Mild Consequence like “Shaken by Guilt” from a character
as they find solace. Encourage roleplay of bonds: a simple meal shared with Ralof or Hadvar can
yield a Boost aspect “ Trust Between Comrades ” in the next battle . 
Campaign Outline
The campaign is divided into five Acts , each comprising major events and turning points in the Civil War .
Acts are structured to accommodate branching outcomes and perspective shifts. If the PCs are Stormcloak-
aligned, scenes are provided from the Stormcloak point of view; if Imperial, from the Imperial side. Neutral
faction PCs (Companions, College, etc.) will have guidance on how to involve them in each Act’s events (e.g.
which side they might assist or unique tasks suited to their faction). Many scenes have variants or sub-
scenes depending on which faction the heroes support – these are clearly indicated below. GMs should feel
free to improvise transitions and even reorder some events based on player choices. Player agency is
paramount : their decisions (which city to strike next, whether to negotiate or press an attack, whom to
trust) can alter the sequence of events. The module notes the most likely sequence for each side, but is
flexible. 
Crucially, the war can end in multiple ways . The default assumption is that the PCs’ chosen faction will
triumph in the Civil War by Act V, but the module provides branches for major battle defeats or alternate
outcomes . It’s possible (with GM creativity) for the war to conclude in a truce or alliance against the
Thalmor if the players pursue that path. Throughout the acts, use Fate mechanics to reinforce the narrative:
invoke location aspects (a raging blizzard, a narrow bridge) during battles, compel character aspects when
their loyalties are tested, and let the outcome of contests shape the political landscape. Major NPCs like
Ulfric and Tullius are story fixtures (plot armor to an extent), but how the PCs influence them (perhaps
swaying Ulfric to mercy or convincing Tullius to consider Nordic customs) can change the flavor of the
ending. 
Below is a summary of the five Acts:
Act I – The Battle of Whiterun: The campaign opens with the epilogue of Alduin’s defeat at the
Throat of the World, then pivots to Whiterun, where the war ignites. The PCs are thrust into the
pivotal Battle for Whiterun , either as Stormcloak attackers or Imperial defenders (or caught in
between). By the end of Act I, Whiterun’s allegiance will be decided and the civil war fully rekindled. 
Act II – Spreading Flames: The war expands to new fronts. Stormcloak forces push into the Empire’s
holds (the Reach, Falkreath), while Imperials launch offensives into rebel territory (the Rift, possibly
the Pale). The PCs engage in military campaigns and city-based story arcs in holds like Markarth
or Riften depending on side. Each major conflict is paired with a Side Plot B – local intrigue or
Daedric meddling that complicates the war . By Act II’s end, the faction map of Skyrim will have visibly
shifted, and clues of Thalmor interference begin to surface in the periphery. 
Act III – The Shadows Lengthen: As each side fights for advantage, internal conflicts and faction
subterfuge come to a head. Acts of sabotage, assassination, and ancient magic occur in cities such
as Windhelm , Dawnstar , or Winterhold . The PCs must resolve city-specific crises (a murderous
conspiracy, a Daedric curse causing chaos, etc.) even as they prepare for the final sieges. Thalmor
agents step up their covert operations, possibly interacting directly with the PCs under false
pretenses. By the end of Act III, the war is one step from climax, but the true enemy is starting to
make their presence felt. 1314

Act IV – The Breaking Point: The penultimate act covers the siege preparation and final battles
for the enemy capital (Solitude if Stormcloak, Windhelm if Imperial). This is when the personal arcs
of major NPC allies Hadvar and Ralof reach their climax. Each faces a profound personal conflict or
sacrifice that can inspire the PCs and sway the battle’s outcome. For example, Ralof might confront
the death of someone dear or a crisis of faith in Ulfric’s cause; Hadvar might be torn between orders
and saving civilians. The war’s victor seems imminent – yet the PCs may discover definitive proof of
the Thalmor’s hidden hand in orchestrating the conflict . Act IV likely ends on a dramatic
note: one of the faction capitals falls, and the true puppet-masters stand revealed. 
Act V – The True Enemy: In the final act, the spotlight shifts to the Thalmor . Armed with evidence
and allies, the PCs take on the Thalmor’s covert operation that aimed to prolong or escalate the war .
This could involve infiltrating the Thalmor Embassy or a secret Dominion outpost, stopping a dark
ritual or assassination plot, or thwarting an attempt to cripple Skyrim in its moment of vulnerability.
Stormcloak and Imperial leaders might be forced into an uneasy alliance in the face of this threat
(the GM can arrange a temporary truce if dramatic). The climactic confrontation pits the PCs against
a formidable Thalmor antagonist – perhaps a First Emissary with deadly magic – and the outcome
will decide Skyrim’s future free of manipulations. Epilogue : The campaign concludes with the war
resolved (one side victorious or a stalemate brokered) and Skyrim either beginning to heal or
bracing for new conflicts to come. Optional epilogue scenes let the PCs reflect on their choices,
possibly even crossing paths with the Dragonborn returning from Solstheim for a brief, poignant
cameo. 
Throughout each act, you’ll find GM tips , branching notes for different factions, and suggestions for
invoking Fate mechanics to enhance play. Now, gather your mead and sharpen your swords – the saga of
Skyrim’s civil war awaits! 
Act I: After Alduin – The Battle of Whiterun
Summary: Act I launches the players into action immediately following the defeat of the World-Eater ,
Alduin. In a vivid opening scene, the sky clears over Skyrim’s tallest peak, and news spreads that the dragon
crisis is over . But any relief is short-lived – without the dragon threat to unite them, the Stormcloak vs.
Imperial conflict erupts anew. The centerpiece of Act I is the Battle of Whiterun , a decisive early clash in
which Whiterun hold’s neutrality is shattered and both factions commit fully to war . The PCs will pick a
side (or find themselves in the crossfire) as Whiterun is besieged. By Act I’s end, Whiterun will either fall to
Stormcloak liberators or remain firmly in Imperial hands, setting the stage for the rest of the campaign. 
Scene 1: Epilogue at the Throat of the World
Setting: High Hrothgar , on the slopes of the Throat of the World. The sun rises over a battered Skyrim. In
the distance, Alduin the World-Eater has been vanquished by the Dragonborn atop the mountain – a
monumental event the PCs may only witness in legend or from afar . 
Narrative: The air is charged with ancient magic as Alduin’s death-throes echo like thunder . Perhaps the
PCs came to High Hrothgar seeking refuge or answers after rumors of dragons. If a PC is a member of the
College of Winterhold or similarly learned, they sense a great disturbance in the flow of magicka – as if a
dark shadow has lifted. If a PC is Nordic or a Companion , they recognize the echoing thu’um shout of the
Dragonborn’s victory as the voice of a hero in Sovngarde’s song. •

Allow each player to describe what their character was doing in these final moments of the dragon crisis.
Are they injured survivors of a dragon attack who staggered up the 7,000 Steps? Did they aid villagers
fleeing a dragon’s wrath en route? This is a chance to tie the characters to recent world events. 
GM Note: You can create a quick Aspect for the environment here, such as “Skies Cleansed by Alduin’s
End” . Any PC can invoke this for comfort or inspiration in the coming scenes (e.g. a +2 when rallying others
with hope: “Take heart, the World-Eater is dead!”). Conversely, you might compel it to remind them that the
Dragonborn’s absence now leaves mortals to face their own conflicts (triggering unease or urgency). This
helps transition from the mythic threat of dragons to the gritty reality of civil war . 
After a brief calm, a messenger (perhaps a loyal Courier Aspect “Wide-Eyed and Out of Breath”) arrives at
High Hrothgar or wherever the PCs are catching their breath. He brings news that Ulfric Stormcloak is
marching on Whiterun . Jarl Balgruuf, erstwhile neutral, has declared for the Empire , refusing Ulfric’s
ultimatum, and now Whiterun city is poised to become the war’s first battlefield. The Civil War has
reignited overnight. The messenger implores any able warriors or mages to hurry to Whiterun’s aid – or , if
the PCs have Stormcloak leanings, perhaps they receive a separate call to arms from a Stormcloak scout: “All
true sons and daughters of Skyrim, rally to Windhelm – the hour to take Whiterun is nigh!” 
This sets the stage: the PCs know Whiterun will be attacked imminently. They have a personal decision –
which side to support, or whether to get involved at all. 
If PCs are Stormcloak-aligned: They likely heed Ulfric’s call and travel toward the Stormcloak camp
near Whiterun to join the assault force. 
If Imperial-aligned: They rush to Whiterun’s defense, possibly joining Legate Quentin Cipius and
Irileth in shoring up the city’s walls. 
If Neutral/Other Faction: Consider their motivations. A Companion PC at Jorrvaskr in Whiterun will
naturally defend their home city (even if the Companions as an organization try to stay neutral,
individual Companions will fight to protect Whiterun’s people). A College of Winterhold mage might
go to observe or test their magic in a real battle. A Dark Brotherhood assassin could be traveling
incognito, only to find a potential high-value target in the chaos. Encourage neutral PCs to involve
themselves – perhaps a personal friend (NPC) in Whiterun begs for help evacuating their family, or
their faction gives them a task (the College might want an artifact secured from Dragonsreach
before it’s sacked, for example). 
Transition the scene by describing the journey to Whiterun. Snow gives way to the tundra plains. As the PCs
approach, they see Whiterun on its hill, the fortress of Dragonsreach silhouetted against a stormy sky.
Camps of soldiers (tents bearing either the red dragon banner of the Empire or the bear of Windhelm) dot
the plains. Tension is in the air . The battle will commence at any moment. 
Scene 2: War Councils and Choices in Whiterun
Before swords clash, give the PCs a chance to participate in their faction’s war council . This frames their
involvement and lets them make strategy suggestions (which can affect the battle’s mechanics). Choose the
appropriate sub-scene based on faction: 
Stormcloak War Council (Stormcloak PCs):
At the Stormcloak camp at Whiterun’s western approach, Ulfric Stormcloak and his field commander17

Galmar Stone-Fist stand over a map on a crate, lit by torchlight. Ralof (if he survived Helgen and is affiliated
with the PC, he’s here as a Stormcloak soldier) gives the PCs a hearty welcome – he’s relieved to have
capable friends on this dangerous day. Ulfric’s voice booms: “Whiterun’s Walls are high, but our cause is
higher! Balgruuf’s refusal of my offer means he has sided with the enemy.” He nods to the PCs,
acknowledging any who escaped Helgen: “You know firsthand the Empire’s disregard for Nord lives.” (Ulfric
might be playing to the crowd here – consider giving Ulfric an Aspect “Charismatic Rebel Jarl” that he’s
using to sway his troops.) 
Galmar lays out the plan gruffly: storm the city gates with a battering ram, while another team uses ladders
near the stables. They expect heavy resistance from Whiterun’s guards and Imperial reinforcements inside.
Here, let the PCs offer ideas or volunteer for key tasks . For instance, a PC might suggest a flanking move
through the undercroft tunnel beneath the city (invent one if needed, perhaps using a Fate Point to
declare a story detail). If so, Galmar can assign them a small squad to infiltrate that way – this can become a
distinct challenge during the battle (avoiding torch patrols in the tunnel, etc.). Another PC might propose
using a captured catapult to bombard the gates first, creating an advantage. Ulfric is open to bold plans if
they promise fewer Stormcloak deaths. 
Use this as a Challenge scene with social skills: perhaps a Command + Strategy challenge. Each overcome
action by PCs to plan or inspire could create Boosts or situation Aspects for the upcoming battle. For
example, if a PC with Tactics or high Lore rolls well to assess the city’s weak points, create an Aspect “Gates
Weak from the Last Raid” (with a free invoke for the battering ram team). If a persuasive PC rallies the
soldiers with a speech invoking Talos (“We fight for the god that the Empire denied us!”), they might place
“Zealous Morale” on the Stormcloak side. Conversely, a failed roll could impose a setback – perhaps
Galmar disagrees and an Aspect “Ulfric’s Doubt” hangs in the air , meaning the PC’s plan won’t have full
support (the GM can invoke that to complicate their plan). 
Ralof is present as an ally who chimes in: “Brothers, sisters, I know many of the Companions in Whiterun.
They won’t take kindly to us storming their city… but they might stay out of the fight if we’re careful.” This
foreshadows that not everyone in Whiterun is a faceless enemy; some are Nord companions they respect. A
Stormcloak PC might choose to later find the Companions and convince them to stay neutral – a possible
flashy social encounter mid-battle instead of combat, if desired. 
Finally, Ulfric raises his fist: “For Skyrim!” The war chant goes up. Stormcloak PCs gain 1 Fate Point each if
they wholeheartedly join the cause here (a compel on any appropriate aspect like “Stormcloak Loyalist” –
rewarding them for binding themselves to Ulfric’s orders). Now, the siege begins! Proceed to Scene 3,
Stormcloak assault. 
Imperial Command Briefing (Imperial PCs):
Inside Dragonsreach , the great hall of Whiterun, Jarl Balgruuf the Greater has reluctantly allowed
Imperial Captain Legate Quentin Cipius and a contingent of Legionnaires to take charge of defense .
The atmosphere is tense; Balgruuf paces, troubled by turning his city into a battlefield, while Irileth (his
Dunmer housecarl) sharpens her blade, ready to defend her Jarl. Hadvar (if he survived Helgen and is
known to the PCs, he’s here, freshly assigned after helgen’s escape) greets the PCs warmly if they’re his
comrades: “Glad you made it – we’ll need every sword. It’s worse than we feared: Ulfric’s got siege engines
out there.” Hadvar’s presence can humanize the Legion for any Nord PCs on the Imperial side – he’s a Nord
fighting for the Empire, just like them, proving not all Imperial soldiers are foreigners. 16

## Page 7

General Tullius is absent (he’s coordinating reinforcements from Solitude), so the defense falls to Legate
Cipius and Balgruuf. Cipius spreads a map on Balgruuf’s war-table (a map of Skyrim marked with colored
flags ). He barks orders: archers on the battlements, barricades at the main gate, and oil cauldrons atop
the walls. Give the PCs a chance to speak up with their own defense plans or volunteer for crucial positions.
For instance, a PC might suggest evacuating civilians to the Temple of Kynareth cellars (preventing collateral
casualties – a Good idea that Balgruuf appreciates, possibly granting a temporary Aspect “City Folk
Sheltered” which means fewer distractions during combat). Another PC might say, “What of the
Companions in Jorrvaskr? Can they aid us?” Balgruuf could note the Companions will defend the city but will
not take official orders – they’ll just protect their mead hall and the local people. This is a hook to involve a
Companion PC or an opportunity for a PC to rally them (if a PC is a Companion, this is their time to lead
their shield-siblings in defense). 
If the PCs have magical ability or siege engineering knowledge, Cipius listens grudgingly. An engineering-
inclined PC might rig a “Collapsing Street Trap” (sandbags or rubble to unleash on Stormcloaks when they
breach – an Advantage they can invoke later). A mage PC could propose using the castle’s old arcane
enchanter to create a one-time ward over the gate – perhaps a Clock with 3 boxes labeled “Ward Integrity”
that ticks down as it absorbs damage. Make these ideas tangible with Fate mechanics: the ward might be an
Aspect “Magical Ward on the Gate” with 3 free invokes (or 3 stress boxes) that Stormcloaks must
overcome before the gate can fall. The PCs may be the ones manning that ward, feeling each shudder as
axes hit. 
Balgruuf will address the garrison with a somber pride: “I have no wish to shed Nord blood on my
doorstep… but neither will I hand Whiterun to Ulfric on a plate. We hold the line here. For Whiterun, and for
the Empire.” This is a potent moment for an Empathy or Leadership roll from a PC to bolster morale.
Success might give the troops an Aspect “Whiterun Stands United” . Failure could instead introduce “Fear
in the Ranks” if the soldiers doubt they can resist the Stormcloak onslaught; Hadvar or the PCs will have to
work harder during the battle to keep order . Hadvar himself can be seen reciting a quiet prayer to Talos
under his breath (a subtle character beat: even some Empire loyalists still worship Talos in secret ,
showing his inner conflict). If a PC notices and has similar leanings, this forms a bond (“You too honor the
Ninth Divine?”). If a Thalmor observer were around, they’d bristle – but none are present… yet. 
By the end of this briefing, Imperial PCs should know their roles: whether manning the main gate defense,
patrolling the ramparts as mobile responders, or guarding a key location like the Skyforge (which could be a
target for the enemy to demoralize Whiterun). Issue Fate Point awards or compels as appropriate: e.g.,
compel an Imperial PC’s “By the Book Soldier” aspect to insist on a strict formation (which might later be a
hindrance if creativity is needed). Or reward a bold plan with an extra Fate Point to the group pot,
symbolizing the resources allocated to their idea. 
Balgruuf gives a final nod: “May the Gods watch over us.” A horn sounds from outside – the Stormcloak
army has arrived at the gates. Battle is upon you. Proceed to the siege scene appropriate to the faction. 
Neutral/Independent PCs in Whiterun:
If the party is not aligned to either side explicitly, they might be present in Whiterun as the attack begins.
Options for their involvement:
- Companions : If any PC is a member of the Companions (or the whole party is a band of Companions),
Kodlak Whitemane or Aela will call them to defend the people of Whiterun. “We’re not political,” Kodlak
growls, “but we’ll be damned if we let our home burn.” The Companions take up arms primarily to protect18
19

## Page 8

citizens and quell chaos, not to advance either faction. The GM can direct neutral PCs to tasks like
evacuating the marketplace, slaying any pillagers (on either side), or rescuing the wounded. They might end
up fighting both Stormcloak raiders and Imperial deserters who take advantage of the confusion. This can
create complex choices – e.g., do they stop a vengeful Nord militia from torching a known Imperial
household?
- College of Winterhold : A mage PC could be in Whiterun researching at Arcadia’s Cauldron or visiting
Farengar Secret-Fire (the Jarl’s court wizard). As battle looms, Farengar eagerly plans to test a scroll of
Fireball on the attackers. The College’s stance is officially neutral, but an individual mage might choose to
assist Whiterun’s defense (scholars often lean Imperial for stability) or simply protect innocents with wards.
A PC mage might be asked by Balgruuf to help maintain the magical ward on the gate (if that was
established), or by a friend in the city to ensure the Gildergreen (sacred tree of Kynareth) isn’t destroyed.
- Dark Brotherhood : If a PC assassin is present, they could have been shadowing a target in Whiterun
when all Oblivion broke loose. The Side Plot for them might involve their target (say, a minor noble or even
the Jarl) being marked for death amid the chaos. In the middle of the siege, an assassin PC might slip away
to fulfill or thwart a contract. Perhaps the Thalmor (secretly) hired the Brotherhood to eliminate Jarl
Balgruuf during the confusion – a contract the PC might know of or even be assigned to! This puts them in a
moral bind: do they defend the Jarl or carry out the assassination? This can foreshadow Thalmor
manipulation if clues link the contract back to an anonymous Altmer benefactor . 
For neutral parties, emphasize moral conflict . They aren’t duty-bound to Stormcloak or Imperial orders, so
they must define their own purpose. Encourage them (with player input) to set goals like “Minimize civilian
casualties” or “Ensure our faction’s interests are secure (e.g., retrieve a Companions heirloom from the
burning hall if needed).” Mechanically, they can treat the battle as a Challenge where success on various
objectives (like an Athletics test to carry water to douse fires, a Fight roll to take down an arsonist, a Rapport
to calm panicked townsfolk) yields a victory condition: e.g., if they accumulate 3 successes before 3 failures,
“Whiterun Civilians Safe” could be an outcome Aspect. Failures might mean some lives lost or property
destroyed, affecting mood and future scenes. 
Once the stage is set for all parties, move to the core action: the siege combat itself. 
Scene 3: The Battle for Whiterun – Siege and Storm
This is the first major Conflict of the campaign – a large-scale battle. It should be run cinematically, with the
PCs’ actions deciding key turning points. We’ll break it into phases and note differences for Stormcloak vs.
Imperial experiences. The GM may handle this as a series of zones (Whiterun’s main gate, the marketplace,
the wall ramparts, etc.) and Waves of enemies , or as a dramatic challenge with a clock for the battle’s
progress. We suggest using a “Siege of Whiterun” clock – perhaps 6 segments – representing which side is
nearing victory. PCs can add ticks to their advantage by accomplishing objectives (raising their flag on the
gate, defeating an enemy commander , etc.), while certain events (the ram breaking through, a section of
wall collapsing) add ticks to the enemy’s side. You might even use two opposed clocks: City Falls vs City
Holds , filling one or the other based on outcomes of clashes. 
Battlefield Aspects: The chaos of siege warfare provides plenty of environment aspects. Some examples to
establish: “Blazing Fires in the Streets” , “Panicked Citizens Underfoot” , “Sturdy Stone Wall (Whiterun’s
outer wall)” , “Rubble and Debris” (from catapult strikes), and “Raging Rainstorm” (perhaps Kynareth
sends rain to quell the flames – or just as dramatic weather). PCs and NPCs can invoke these for advantage
8

## Page 9

or the GM can compel them: e.g., compel Blazing Fires on a Stormcloak to force them to detour , or invoke
Rubble to give a PC archer a steady rest for their bow. 
Stormcloak Side – Taking Whiterun:
Stormcloak PCs begin outside the gates amid the assault. The first phase is breaching the gates. Galmar
Stone-Fist leads a charge with the battering ram under a hail of arrows. The PCs could be holding the ram
(requiring Physique checks as a group effort Overcome each exchange to break it down), or providing cover
to the ram team. Perhaps one PC handles a siege catapult acquired earlier – each successful shoot action
with it could reduce a gate “stress track.” Here you can treat the City Gate as an opponent with, say, 3 stress
boxes and a Moderate consequence (“Gate Splintered”). The Stormcloaks must overcome it to enter . If the
PCs had set up advantages in the War Council (like soaked the gate in oil stealthily, etc.), allow them to
invoke those now for extra damage. 
About two exchanges in, Whiterun’s defenders will unleash a volley of flaming arrows or drop rocks. One
PC (or a nameless Stormcloak at GM’s whim) might take a hit – offer a Minor Consequence “Arrow Burn
Wound” . This is a good time for a Compel : perhaps compel a PC’s Brash Berserker aspect to charge ahead
alone on a ladder , separating them on top of the wall (new zone) surrounded by enemies. If they accept,
Fate Point awarded, and now they have a solo scene atop the rampart fighting off 2-3 guards – a heroic but
risky position! They could create the Aspect “Distracted Defenders” if they hold them off, helping
comrades below. Other PCs might need to rescue them or use Create Advantage (like firing an arrow to cut
a rope that drops a banner on some guards). Encourage creative stunts – e.g., a PC Nord might use “Battle
Cry” stunt to intimidate a section of guards, forcing them back (maybe an area-of-effect provoke attack
causing a mild fear consequence on the NPCs). 
Once the gate is breached (perhaps with a satisfying crash and cheer), the second phase moves into
Whiterun’s streets. Stormcloak PCs can now push into the market district . Describe vivid chaos: merchants’
stalls overturned, a house on fire (the Bannered Mare inn, perhaps). Whiterun’s Battle-Born clan (loyal to
the Empire) are actually taking up arms too – you might show old Olfrid Battle-Born and sons firing from
windows at Stormcloaks. Meanwhile, the Gray-Manes (secret Stormcloak sympathizers) might be helping
Stormcloak wounded to cover . This gives a sense of the city’s own split and may present a social choice: do
Stormcloak PCs focus on military targets or also ensure their local allies (Gray-Manes) are safe from
reprisals? If a PC has the Aspect “Skyrim’s People First” , compel them to prioritize rescuing a Gray-Mane
child from a burning house instead of chasing an enemy officer . 
A key objective for Stormcloaks here could be reaching Dragonsreach (the keep) at the top. But first, Jarl
Balgruuf himself enters the fray in the streets, clad in armor and swinging his hammer Wuthrad (if you
fancy a lore moment – maybe he wields the ancient axe of Ysgramor loaned by the Companions). Balgruuf,
defended by Irileth and Housecarl Hrongar , makes a stand at the Gildergreen tree in the Wind District. He
shouts for the attackers to turn back or face the wrath of a true Nord and his companions. This is an
opportunity for a dramatic confrontation . The PCs might duel Irileth or other notable NPCs here while
soldiers clash around. If a Stormcloak PC tries to convince Balgruuf to surrender (maybe appealing to his
care for his people, reminding him Whiterun need not be destroyed), that could be handled as a Contest of
Rapport vs. his stubborn Will. A victory might get Balgruuf to yield later with honor if pressed enough. More
likely, the fight must play out. 
Major NPC Notes (Battle of Whiterun):
- Ralof (Stormcloak NPC Ally) – He fights alongside the PCs if present. Give him an Aspect “Fiercely Loyal
9

## Page 10

Stormcloak” and a Stunt like Brotherhood in Battle: Because Ralof never abandons a shield-brother, once per
conflict he can intercept an attack meant for a nearby ally. Use him cinematically – maybe he saves a PC from
an ambushing Imperial with a timely axe throw. Ralof’s presence should add heart; he might utter , “By Shor ,
we’re really doing this,” with equal parts sorrow and determination as he fights fellow Nords of Whiterun.
- Balgruuf the Greater – He is a staunch fighter but not reckless. If badly wounded (e.g., taken a Moderate or
Severe consequence “Cracked Ribs”), he’ll fall back toward the keep. If the Stormcloaks seem to clearly have
won, he will yield rather than have his city utterly ruined, telling his Housecarl to stand down. The
Stormcloaks then would capture him.
- Irileth – The Dunmer housecarl might duel a PC rogue or mage. She has an Aspect “Unflinching
Protector” (and could be compelled to fight to the death unless Balgruuf specifically orders her to live on).
- Hadvar (if somehow present with Stormcloaks?) – Unlikely; he’s on the other side. But if the PCs managed to
talk during Helgen and remain friendly, maybe they spot him on the wall as an enemy. Locking eyes, there’s
recognition – a potential compel for later . They might even trade a few shouted words mid-battle (“You don’t
have to do this!” “I gave my oath to the Legion, friend – Talos protect you.”). This humanizes the conflict. 
Ultimately, the Stormcloak goal is to force Balgruuf’s surrender and raise the Stormcloak banner over
Whiterun. The final phase could be storming Dragonsreach. However , given the chaos, it might be achieved
by negotiation if enough key NPCs are down. Outcome – Stormcloak Victory: If the PCs and Stormcloaks
defeat Balgruuf’s forces, the Jarl surrenders Whiterun. A cheer goes up: Whiterun is in Stormcloak hands.
Ulfric arrives (later , after the fighting) to commend the heroes. He names Vignar Gray-Mane as the new Jarl
, and the Stormcloak banner is hoisted atop Dragonsreach. The city’s strategic value is immense: with
Whiterun taken, the Stormcloaks now have the central hold and can threaten all Imperial positions . PCs
are hailed as heroes of the assault (likely earning a couple of Fate Points for completing this milestone). But
they also witness the cost: buildings smoldering, soldiers tending wounded, families grieving. The act
should close with a mix of triumph and somber reflection. Perhaps Ralof thanks them quietly: “My sister’s
family made it through safely, thanks to you pulling that burning timber off her house.” That personal touch
anchors the victory. 
Outcome – Stormcloak Defeat (Alternate): It’s possible (though unlikely in the game’s narrative, the GM
can allow it for dramatic effect) that the Stormcloak attack fails – say the PCs make grave errors or flee, or
Balgruuf’s forces rout them. In this case, many Stormcloaks retreat or are captured. If PCs survive, they may
have to escape Whiterun under pursuit or conceal themselves among sympathizers until nightfall. Ulfric’s
army is repelled this day. This will significantly alter Act II: Stormcloaks would regroup for a second attempt
or shift strategy (maybe attacking the Reach first to avoid Whiterun for now). The module can proceed with
the war continuing, but the Imperials will hold Whiterun in the interim, bolstering Imperial morale. GMs
should adapt by perhaps compressing some later battles or having Ulfric attempt a different approach (like
obtaining an Elder Scroll… though that goes into the fantastical). Ensure the PCs still have paths forward –
maybe they must rescue Ralof from execution after the failed attack (a side mission) or regain Ulfric’s trust.
This failure branch can be extremely interesting, highlighting the tragedy of war (not every heroic charge
succeeds). However , for scope, we’ll assume the default path is Stormcloak success at Whiterun, since the
rest of the Acts anticipate progression. But we encourage keeping this loss-outcome in your back pocket if
drama calls for it. 
Imperial Side – Defending Whiterun:
For Imperial-aligned PCs, flip the perspective. They start on the walls or at the main gate, bracing for
impact. 20

## Page 11

First phase : Hold the Gate. The Stormcloaks’ ram pounds the reinforced gate. Imperial PCs might be
coordinating arrow volleys or dumping boiling oil. One PC could command a squad of archers – treat that
like an Advantage “Disciplined Archers” they create and can invoke as a free tag when an enemy rushes.
Each round the gate holds is a success for them. Perhaps set a simple clock “Gate Breach” with 4 boxes –
ticking as the ram hits (maybe one per round unless PCs do something to slow it). PCs could sally out
through a side postern gate to sabotage the ram (a risky maneuver , but a cool mini-mission: fight through a
few Stormcloak elites, maybe plant a keg of firepowder on the ram). If they try this, narrate it as a quick
outside-the-walls skirmish under fire. A successful Sabotage could add the Aspect “Ram in Flames” , halving
the attackers’ effectiveness. But being outside might expose them to being cut off – Hadvar or another NPC
might have to open the sally gate again under covering fire to let them back in (nice tension scene). 
On the wall, give each PC a moment: e.g., a ranger-type PC can target the Stormcloak flag-bearer with a
bow shot. Dropping the bear-banner can impose “Stormcloak Disarray” for a bit, a moral blow. A mage PC
could unleash a lightning bolt at the siege tower (if Stormcloaks have one), perhaps blowing it apart (invoke
“Storm Clouds Gathered” if any to supercharge it). Use NPC calls to action: Legate Cipius yells from one
tower , “Hold, you bastards, hold!” and perhaps gets hit by an arrow (taking a Moderate consequence “Arrow
to Shoulder” ). He might drop, leaving an opportunity for a PC to take command of his sector – a chance
for leadership. If they do, they might later get promoted (reputation boost). 
Second phase : Wall Breach and Street Fighting. Likely the Stormcloaks manage to force entry (in The
Elder Scrolls lore, Whiterun falls to Stormcloaks if the player sides with them, so either outcome is possible;
we show both). If the gate falls, or siege towers unload Stormcloaks onto the battlements, now Imperial PCs
fight within the city. Set scenes in key locations: the market, near Jorrvaskr (the Companions’ hall), and by
the Gildergreen tree. The Imperials must protect Jarl Balgruuf and push the Stormcloaks back out. 
A fun twist: A Stormcloak battering ram team bursts through the gate, but as they charge in, they trigger a
trap the PCs suggested – e.g., spikes hidden in the ground or a palisade funnel. Describe Stormcloak
soldiers impaled or stumbling – giving the PCs a momentary upper hand. At this point, you can introduce a
Stormcloak named NPC (maybe Ralof if he’s alive and the PCs met him in Helgen, now on the opposite side).
Ralof might recognize the PCs atop the wall or on the field: “Hadvar! You damn milk-drinker , I knew I’d find
you here!” If Hadvar is an NPC ally to the PCs, he can engage in a brief duel of words with Ralof before
swords, illustrating two friends now foes. Perhaps Ralof calls out a PC Nord: “You fight for them? The
Thalmor’s pawns?!” This can be a mental attack via provoke on the PC’s belief – compel their Nord Pride to
shake them. Resolving this could be roleplayed: the PC might shout back, “I fight to protect our people, not
tear our home apart!” – if well-said, that could even stun Ralof (remove an invoke of Stormcloak morale).
This personal touch makes the battle more than nameless enemies. 
Major objective for Imperials: Keep Jarl Balgruuf Safe and Hold Dragonsreach. Possibly at some point,
Stormcloaks make a push for Dragonsreach (with Ulfric’s axe-wielding lieutenant, Galmar , at the forefront).
Imperial PCs could form the last line of defense in the throne room. Picture a cinematic showdown: Galmar
and a couple of Stormcloak officers smash into the hall. A PC stands guard before Balgruuf’s throne while
the Jarl, wounded, tries to pull himself to fight. Legate Rikke might even arrive as reinforcement if you want
to include her (she’s likely at Solitude at first, but could belatedly come). Regardless, the PCs might directly
duel Galmar Stone-Fist here. Give Galmar an appropriate profile: Aspect “Old Bear of the Stormcloaks” ,
with a Stunt like Blood on the Snow: Galmar gets +2 to attack when he’s taken a consequence (fighting harder
wounded). This makes him a tough foe who actually becomes more dangerous as he’s injured. The fight with
Galmar could be pivotal: if he is defeated (or even killed, if you allow that – though Galmar is plot-important
11

on Stormcloak side, the GM might choose not to have him die here unless planning big deviations), the
Stormcloaks’ morale plunges and they may retreat. If he overpowers the PCs, he might hold Balgruuf at
axe-point, forcing surrender . 
Imperial Victory in Whiterun (Repelling the Stormcloaks): If the Imperials hold, the Stormcloak forces
withdraw after heavy losses. Whiterun’s citizens rejoice cautiously – but Balgruuf is grim, knowing this was
just the first battle. Tullius arrives later , clapping the PCs on the shoulder: “Well done. You’ve proven the
Legion isn’t just foreign generals – Skyrim’s own sons and daughters fought bravely here.” He likely rewards
them (perhaps a Promotion aspect like “Proven Defender of Whiterun” which might grant an honor or
medal they can invoke socially in Imperial territories). Hadvar is relieved his home (Riverwood, nearby) is
safe for now. But there’s fallout: parts of Whiterun are damaged (the outer gate smashed, a section of wall
broken), and whispers spread that the Thalmor might be pleased – since Skyrim weakened itself today,
regardless of victor . Balgruuf thanks the PCs personally, offering them mead in Dragonsreach and
voicing his sorrow that Nords had to kill Nords. “This cannot be what Talos wants for us,” he muses, setting
a tone of regret. The war will go on, however , and the Legion now has momentum to strike back at Ulfric’s
holdings. 
Stormcloak Victory in Whiterun (Alternate, if Imperials fail): Should the players badly fail and Whiterun
fall under their watch, it’s a dark moment. Balgruuf is exiled or captured, Imperial troops retreat if possible.
PCs might have to escape as the city falls (perhaps carrying a grievously wounded Hadvar out of the
carnage). This sets a very different tone for Act II – Imperials on the back foot, regrouping to defend the
next hold. The campaign can still proceed, but likely with an urgent drive to reclaim Whiterun later . The
PCs might be blamed by superiors (unfairly or fairly) for the loss; they may seek redemption by
extraordinary heroics in upcoming battles. It can be a powerful motivator . GMs could incorporate an event
where General Tullius, furious, says, “We’ll retake Whiterun if it’s the last thing we do – and you, my friends,
will be at the tip of the spear .” The next acts would then include a detour to reclaim Whiterun. However , for
the standard path, we’ll assume Imperials successfully defend Whiterun in Act I (since that aligns with
many playthroughs and because either side can plausibly win here). 
Neutral Party in the Battle:
Neutral PCs will have their own measures of success aside from the city’s fate. After the battle, gauge how
well they accomplished their personal objectives: Did they save all the civilians they intended to? Did they
keep the Temple of Kynareth from burning, or slay that rampaging frost troll someone let loose from the
palace menagerie (you can throw in a random chaotic event like that for fun)? If they succeeded, reward
them with positive aspects like “Trusted by Whiterun Citizens” (the people saw them help). If they failed in
some tasks (perhaps they saved many but couldn’t prevent a portion of the city from igniting), impose a
temporary aspect “Haunted by Whiterun’s Flames” on one or more PCs, representing trauma or guilt –
this can be compelled in future scenes where similar stakes arise, driving home war’s cost. Neutral PCs
might not shift the macro outcome of who holds Whiterun, but they could influence how much
destruction occurs or who survives . For example, if they worked to minimize violence, maybe Jarl
Balgruuf’s children and family are safely escorted out before Stormcloaks breach (preventing a tragic
massacre). That can have story value later (those family members might later beseech aid to rescue
Balgruuf or thank the PCs). Or if they prioritized taking out key aggressors, maybe the battle ends quicker .
Decide based on their actions whether Whiterun fell to Stormcloaks or not; neutrals could tip balance if they
choose a side mid-battle (e.g., the Companions ultimately side with Balgruuf, turning the tide to Imperials –
or maybe they side with Stormcloaks if something sways them). You as GM can justifiably choose whichever
outcome serves the ongoing story or the players’ leanings, since neutral PCs give some freedom. Just21

ensure the consequences of Act I naturally lead to Act II’s scenarios (we provide for both faction control
maps). 
Aftermath of Act I: Whiterun’s New Dawn
As the smoke clears, Act I concludes with a brief epilogue scene in Whiterun. Give the players a moment to
breathe and roleplay: perhaps at Jorrvaskr mead hall, whether in victory or defeat. If Stormcloaks won,
they may be attending a victory gathering in the great hall of Dragonsreach; if Imperials won, maybe a field
hospital scene in the Temple of Kynareth, treating wounded. This is an Interlude where consequences can
be healed (bandage wounds, drink to numb pain) and relationships deepened. 
Encourage each player to reflect in-character on what just happened. A somber Nord might lament fighting
kinsmen. A fierce one might celebrate glory in battle. A clever one might already worry: “Ulfric/Tullius won’t
stop now. This was just the beginning.” Offer a Fate Point if a PC’s Trouble could surface here – e.g., a PC
with “PTSD from the Great War” might suffer a panic attack at the smell of ash (compel that to have them
step outside for air , where an NPC follows to comfort them, providing a touching scene). Or a young
idealistic soldier PC might over-celebrate, only to be confronted by a distraught civilian (“My home… my
shop… it’s gone.”), tempering their zeal. 
Also, foreshadow the Thalmor strongly here for the first time. Perhaps while tending the wounded, Hadvar
(Imperial) quietly confides to a PC he trusts: “Legate Fasendil told me something… he suspects the Thalmor
are pulling strings to keep this war raging . After today, I believe it. Who really won? The elves must be
laughing.” If Stormcloak side, maybe Ralof mentions, “Mark my words, the Thalmor will come sniffing. They
always do – like crows after a battle.” These comments plant seeds that there’s a bigger picture. PCs with
Lore or contacts could even find a clue: maybe among the corpses, an Imperial PC finds a Stormcloak
soldier’s orders that oddly include an addendum in Aldmeri script (some coded Thalmor note). Or vice
versa: a Stormcloak PC finds an Imperial missive referencing Elenwen, the Thalmor ambassador , subtly.
They likely can’t decode it yet, but the detail is there . 
Finally, reward and recognition: If Stormcloaks took Whiterun, Ulfric might send a personal message
thanking the heroes and promising them a stake in the new Skyrim (perhaps a minor treasure or a field
promotion to “Ice-Veins” rank). If Imperials held it, General Tullius might arrive by horse to congratulate
them, or Jarl Balgruuf promises to remember their service (a potential title or gift of a weapon named in
their honor down the line). These rewards can be abstracted as Aspect permissions – e.g., “Hero of
Whiterun” aspect can be invoked in social situations in that hold for respect, or to requisition supplies from
locals. 
With Whiterun’s fate decided, Act I ends . The Civil War is now in full blaze. The hold map of Skyrim shifts:
Whiterun belongs to whoever prevailed, and both factions lick their wounds and strategize the next moves.
The players have forged their reputations in fire and blood. Ahead lies a wider war across Skyrim’s nine
holds – and more hidden perils as the Thalmor and Daedric influences begin to surface in earnest. Gather
the war maps and prepare for Act II – the flames of conflict spread to every corner of the land. 22

Act II: Spreading Flames – War on Multiple Fronts
Summary: In Act II, the civil war escalates and engulfs multiple holds. After the clash at Whiterun, both
sides mobilize for broader campaigns. The PCs will experience military engagements in two or more
regions , and we’ll delve into city-based story arcs in those locales. If the PCs are Stormcloak-aligned, they
will focus on liberating Imperial-controlled holds (like Falkreath Hold and The Reach), whereas Imperial-
aligned PCs will concentrate on crushing rebellion in Stormcloak territories (such as the Rift and The Pale).
Neutral faction PCs may choose or be thrust into one front or shuttle between them. Act II features at least
two major battles or operations, each tied to a hold capital and accompanied by a Side Plot B – a subplot of
intrigue or supernatural meddling that occurs in parallel with the military action. These side plots not only
add depth and variety (investigation, diplomacy, or dungeon-crawl style encounters), but also begin to
reveal the covert work of the Thalmor (or other forces) behind the scenes. By the end of Act II, the war’s
brutality will be on full display, one or two more cities will have changed hands, and the PCs should start
suspecting that someone is manipulating events for their own gain . 
Act II Structure: This act can be played somewhat non-linearly. Depending on player choices, they might
tackle objectives in a different order . We present two primary “campaigns” in Act II – one for each faction
perspective – but GMs can intercut them or adapt as needed. Also consider geography: the holds targeted
often border the one taken in Act I. For example, if Stormcloaks hold Whiterun now, they might strike west
into The Reach (Markarth) next, or south into Falkreath . If Imperials solidified Whiterun, they likely push
east into The Rift (Riften) or north into The Pale (Dawnstar) . We’ll detail two major operations: Operation
Hammerfall (Stormcloak liberation of The Reach) and Operation Shadowfang (Imperial offensive in
The Rift) as representative arcs. GMs can swap these if different holds make more sense or use them as
templates for other holds (e.g., an Imperial operation in Winterhold would have similarities to the Rift plan
but different flavor). 
Throughout Act II, maintain the theme of war spreading like wildfire . Show refugees on the roads, new
local militias rising, and how everyday life is disrupted in each hold. And in each location, highlight city-
specific unrest or questlines that can entangle the PCs. The side plots will tie into Daedric or faction
intrigue – the Thalmor’s hand might not be obvious yet, but careful PCs could notice a pattern (e.g., in every
hold, some chaos occurs that conveniently weakens that hold’s ability to fight, benefitting the Thalmor’s
goal of prolonging conflict). 
Stormcloak Campaign – “Operation Hammerfall” (Liberating the Reach)
Setting the Stage (Stormcloak context): With Whiterun in Stormcloak hands (assuming Act I outcome for
Stormcloaks), Ulfric turns his eyes westward to the Reach , the hold of Markarth . The Reach is a rich prize –
its silver mines and strategic position are vital. It’s also symbolic: Ulfric’s rebellion traces back to the
Markarth Incident, where he once liberated the city from Reachmen (Forsworn) only to be betrayed by the
Empire’s concordat with the Thalmor . Now Markarth is held by Jarl Igmund, a young Imperial
loyalist, and heavily garrisoned by Legion troops and local militia (the Silver-Blood mercenaries). Ulfric
codenames the plan to take The Reach “Operation Hammerfall” – a nod to Shor’s sacred hammer and the
idea of smashing Imperial power in the west. The Stormcloak army will need to capture strategic forts (such
as Fort Sungard or Fort Greenwall – though Fort Greenwall is in the Rift, you can adapt fort names as
needed) to cut off Markarth, then besiege the city. PCs are likely to be at the forefront, given their
achievements at Whiterun. 12

Before the main assault, there’s a briefing in Windhelm (or in Whiterun if Ulfric moved his court there
temporarily to command). Ulfric addresses his war council, including Galmar (nursing some wounds if he
survived Whiterun) and the PC Stormcloaks. Galmar growls that the Reachmen (Forsworn) are also active in
the hills, complicating things: “Those Forsworn devils hate the Nords and the Empire both – they’ll surely try
to murder us as we march in, or worse, strike Markarth amid the chaos.” Ulfric tasks the PCs with a crucial
preliminary mission: to secure the Karth River valley approach so the main army can move. This might
involve taking Fort Sungard (an old fortress on a hill in the Reach) or clearing a large Forsworn camp that
could ambush their supply line. Essentially, the PCs must handle a mid-sized battle or infiltration to pave
the way for the larger siege. This can be a classic Dungeon/Combat scenario using Fate challenges. 
Scene 1 (Stormcloak): Clearing Fort Sungard / Dealing with the Forsworn
The Forsworn are a tribal insurgent faction of rebellious natives in the Reach. They are neither friend to
Stormcloaks nor Imperials , seeking to reclaim their land from all Nords. This presents an interesting dynamic:
The PCs could attempt to negotiate with Forsworn leaders (perhaps promising them autonomy or rights if
Ulfric wins) or simply fight them as enemies. The module encourages a chance for diplomacy, albeit risky –
it’s an opportunity for a politically-minded PC to shine. Ulfric privately doesn’t mind if the Forsworn get
slaughtered (they’ve terrorized Nord settlers), but a PC might see value in neutralizing them through a
truce. 
Option A – Combat Route: The PCs lead a strike team to Fort Sungard , currently occupied by a mix of
Imperial scouts and Forsworn who have taken advantage of the region’s instability. It’s a nighttime raid
under torchlight. Battlefield Aspects: Narrow mountain trails, bone totems that induce fear (Forsworn
magic), and the fort’s crumbling walls (easy to climb in spots). This can be run as a contest or challenge :
the PCs must secure three key areas (the outer wall, the courtyard, the fort interior). Each key area can be
an overcome action or small conflict. For example: - Outer Wall: Sneak up and silently take out the lookout
archers (Stealth or Fight). Success = they gain entry quietly (Aspect “Surprise Gained” for next fight). Failure
= alarm sounded, they face a volley of arrows as they climb (each PC might have to roll Athletics to avoid a
minor hit).
- Courtyard Skirmish: Forsworn barbarians and perhaps a domesticated bear (! why not?) rush them. One PC
might handle the bear (a Create Advantage to scare it off or Acrobatics to lead it into a trap pit). Others duel
the Forsworn. They notice some Imperial soldiers’ corpses staked on pikes here – evidence the Forsworn
overcame an Imperial patrol earlier . This scene seeds the cruelty of the Forsworn.
- Interior Showdown: In the fort’s central hall, a Forsworn Briarheart shaman leads a ritual around a
captured Imperial officer , intending a blood sacrifice to their Daedra (perhaps Hagraven totem to the
Daedric Prince Hircine or Namira). The Briarheart has a literal briar heart (magical) granting him resilience –
an aspect “Briarheart’s Regeneration” that PCs might overcome by specifically targeting it (a called shot
type action). During the fight, the shaman might unleash a burst of nature magic – e.g., vines erupt from
the stone floor (Aspect “Entangling Vines” to complicate movement). Once the PCs defeat him (or he
escapes via secret tunnel if you want a recurring villain), the fort is theirs. They can choose to free the
captured Imperial officer or not; that officer could yield intel (like Markarth’s gate codes or number of
legionaries inside Markarth). Freeing them might seem odd (a Stormcloak killing Imperials normally), but if
a PC has a kind heart, this Imperial’s gratitude could become useful later (maybe he defects or helps reduce
needless bloodshed in the final siege). 
After victory, they raise the bear-banner over Fort Sungard. A Stormcloak courier rushes to Ulfric with news
that the way is clear . The PCs might also find clues here: perhaps a Thalmor order on the dead Imperial
officer indicating he was tasked to watch for Thalmor sightings (Legate Fasendil’s influence – a nod that
15


---

## Page 16

even the Empire suspects Thalmor meddling ). Or they discover the Forsworn were equipped with
unusually fine steel arrows – bearing an Elven make. Could it be the Thalmor quietly armed the Forsworn to
harass both sides? (This is indeed a plausible thing – weaken the Reach by encouraging conflict between
Nords and Reachmen, something the Thalmor would smile upon.) PCs might deduce or at least note the
oddity. 
Option B – Diplomatic Route: The PCs decide to parley with the Forsworn rather than attack. Perhaps they
send a scout ahead with a white flag. The Forsworn leader is a hagraven or chieftain named e.g. Cadius the
Crow-Eyed . Arrange a meeting on neutral ground – perhaps a stone circle atop a cliff at dusk, with
Forsworn painted warriors watching from above. This negotiation is extremely tense; use Opposed
Rapport/Deceive vs. Insight . The Forsworn want Markarth for themselves. They view Ulfric’s lot as no
better than the Empire – both persecuted them. A clever PC might promise that if Stormcloaks win, they will
withdraw Nord settlers from some Redoubt areas or at least cease persecution of Forsworn worship.
(This is a big promise – perhaps a lie, which would be a Deception roll. If found out later , it could have
repercussions.) They could also point out a common enemy: “Why weaken ourselves fighting each other ,
when the real enemy is the Thalmor who would kill both Nord and Reachman?” If they have evidence (like
that elven arrow or knowledge that Thalmor fear a united Skyrim), they might persuade the Forsworn to a
truce of convenience. 
Likely outcomes: If successful, the Forsworn agree to sit out the battle for Markarth and not harass
Stormcloak supply lines (Aspect “Forsworn Truce” ). They won’t fight alongside Nords, but even this
neutrality is a boon. Perhaps they even secretly give a token of trust: the PC negotiator receives a
reachmen talisman that can be shown to other Forsworn to grant safe passage. Mechanically, the PCs
earn an extra invoke or remove a potential obstacle from the siege (no Forsworn guerilla attacks). If the roll
fails badly or the PCs offend them (very possible, given cultural hatred), the meeting could explode into an
ambush. In that case, it shifts to combat with unfavorable positioning – maybe the PCs must retreat under
arrow fire or fight their way out of an encirclement. Surviving that, they’ll probably resort to Option A after
all, albeit with more difficulty (and perhaps one PC with a new arrow scar consequence). 
Side Plot B – “The Forsworn Conspiracy” (Markarth Intrigue):
As the Stormcloak army marches toward Markarth for the big siege, an intriguing subplot unfolds within
the city’s stone walls. Markarth , the City of Stone, is rife with internal tension: the native Reachmen (some
secretly Forsworn sympathizers) versus Nord settlers, the ruling Silver-Blood family’s stranglehold on
commerce, and rumors of a Daedric presence in the haunted halls of Understone Keep. In Elder Scrolls V,
there is a quest named “The Forsworn Conspiracy” involving murders in Markarth orchestrated by Forsworn
agents in the city. We adapt a version of that here to give the PCs a chance for investigation or social
maneuvering either before the siege (if they can infiltrate the city) or during the siege as a parallel objective.
Premise: A series of mysterious murders has occurred in Markarth’s streets, targeting figures loyal to the
Jarl and Empire. The killer leaves a distinctive token – the engraved symbol of the Forsworn – on each
body. Panic and distrust grows in the city. Jarl Igmund’s men suspect a Forsworn sleeper cell is active,
possibly planning sabotage when the Stormcloaks arrive. In truth, the murders are being committed by
Forsworn agents (possibly led by an old man named Nepos the Nose , a respected citizen who is secretly a
Forsworn leader – as in the game). However , here’s the twist: the Thalmor know about it and have quietly
decided not to interfere (maybe even subtly encouraging it), because it serves their goal of weakening
Markarth’s defenses from within. If the PCs do nothing, this conspiracy could result in the city guard being
distracted or key figures killed right when the siege hits, causing more chaos (which helps prolong and22

## Page 17

bloody the battle – a Thalmor win). So unraveling this plot can save lives and shorten the conflict – exactly
what the Thalmor don’t want. Thus, the Thalmor will covertly try to thwart any investigation, possibly via a
Thalmor operative in the city (a Justiciar posing as a diplomat). 
How PCs engage: If Stormcloak PCs are outside, they might not directly investigate in the city before
capturing it. However , they could become aware of it via intel from sympathetic citizens or infiltrators.
Perhaps Elisif the Fair’s court in Solitude passed word to Ulfric that “something is amiss in Markarth –
murders blamed on Forsworn.” Ulfric, seeing an opportunity, could ask the PCs to contact the Forsworn (if
friendly) about it, or more pragmatically, to use the chaos to their advantage. But Ulfric wouldn’t care to
stop the murders (they hurt Imperial loyalists). It might fall on the PCs’ conscience: fewer innocents dead =
better moral high ground. Alternatively, if the PCs negotiated a truce with Forsworn outside, one Forsworn
druid might tip them off: “Some of our vengeful kin inside the city act tonight. Blood will flow in Markarth’s
streets.” That might spur them. 
During the siege, if/when they breach Markarth, they could then actively seek out Nepos or others to stop a
hidden plan (perhaps the Forsworn agents intend to open the city gates at a specific time – helpful to
Stormcloaks actually! But they might also plan to massacre civilians or assassinate Jarl Igmund in the chaos,
which Ulfric might not want if he prefers to capture Igmund alive for legitimacy reasons). The PCs face a
choice: let the Forsworn cell run wild (makes victory easier but at cost of civilian lives and giving Forsworn a
foot-hold), or intervene to stabilize things (harder fight for them, but morally right and denies Thalmor a
messy prolonged urban conflict). 
Key investigative scenes (if they undertake them):
- Discovering clues of the conspiracy: a note on a dead vigilant with Nepos’s name, or an encounter with
Eltrys (a citizen whose family was victimized) who begs them to look into it.
- Infiltrating Nepos’s house: if done stealthily during battle or just after victory, they might catch him
performing a dark Daedric ritual to Molag Bal or Namira, fueling the murderous rage of his followers.
Indeed, Markarth houses the abandoned house with Molag Bal’s shrine – maybe Nepos is working with a
Hagraven there to summon Daedric aid to slaughter Nord citizens as revenge. The PCs could storm that
mini-dungeon (a creepy horror-themed encounter with whispers of a Daedric prince).
- A confrontation with a Thalmor Justiciar: Perhaps Elenwen herself (or a lesser Thalmor like Ondolemar ,
who in game is in Markarth as a Justiciar) steps in “to secure the Jarl’s safety” but subtly hinders the PCs. If
they recognize him as Thalmor , they might wonder why he’s not helping catch the Forsworn – maybe he
even tries to kill a Forsworn witness before they can talk. A chase or duel with a Thalmor agent in the
burning streets could be a thrilling aside. If captured, that Thalmor might smugly hint: “This war … we’ve
been watching . You have no idea how you’re dancing on our strings.” Most likely, he escapes to maintain the
bigger mystery. 
Resolution: If PCs resolve the Forsworn conspiracy by Act II’s end (e.g., Nepos is defeated and his cell
dismantled, saving whoever was targeted like Jarl Igmund or Thane Thongvor), they effectively lessen
Thalmor influence here. Give them a benefit: Markarth’s civilian population is calmer , meaning maybe fewer
losses or the new Jarl (if Stormcloak, Thongvor Silver-Blood likely) has an easier time establishing order . If
they ignore it, Markarth post-battle is a nightmare of continued insurgency – which will occupy Stormcloak
resources for acts to come (maybe a compel in Act III about “Constant Unrest in Markarth” interfering with
their war plans). 
Now, moving back to the military front:

Scene 2 (Stormcloak): Siege of Markarth – Stone and Silver
With Fort Sungard/Forsworn dealt with, the Stormcloaks surround Markarth. Markarth is unique: built into
a cliff of Dwemer ruins, with natural defenses. A single main gate crosses a bridge over a river chasm. It’s
hard to assault head-on. However , inside the city, unrest (the Forsworn conspiracy) may have weakened the
defense. PCs might implement strategies: scaling a side wall near the waterfall, sneaking through
Understone Keep’s dwemer ruins if they discovered an entrance, or using the classic Trojan Horse trick
(maybe captured caravan wagons from the Reach are rolled to the gate, filled with Stormcloak troops hiding
under hay). Let the players be creative. Use their earlier actions: if they allied with Forsworn, perhaps some
Forsworn in the city open a sally port for them (though that could lead to Forsworn also rampaging). If they
wiped out the Forsworn cell, then it’s purely a Stormcloak vs Imperial fight. 
Phase 1: Breach the Gates or Walls. The Markarth city gate is reinforced Dwemer stone. A frontal ram
might be impractical. If players planted explosives (maybe mining black powder from Dawnstar earlier? If
any), this is a good payoff: blowing the gate open. Otherwise, they might opt for a distraction and climb :
cause commotion at the front (fire arrows, siege noise) while a team scales the less-guarded back wall near
the river . A PC with Climbing or Magic could lead that. This is an overcome (Athletics or Stealth) with the risk
of a fall into rapids if failed. Once atop, they secure a small foothold on the battlements and can drop ropes
for others – essentially opening a way. A conflict breaks out on the walls with Markarth guards (who use
Reach for fighting style, perhaps lighter armor but deadly scimitars). 
Markarth’s ballistae (Dwemer built maybe) fire from towers; a PC might prioritize taking those out before
they skewer Stormcloak ranks below. Perhaps one dramatic moment: a ballista bolt nails a Stormcloak
captain to a wall. A PC could try a Craft or Sabotage roll to turn a captured ballista around on the defenders
(tagging “Captured Dwarven Ballista” to rain their own quarrels on them). 
Phase 2: Street Fighting in Markarth. Markarth’s layout is terraced. Stormcloaks fight through the market
terrace (where Silver-Blood Inn and shops are). Civilians cower in the Warrens and under bridges.
Emphasize environment: narrow stone streets, lots of cover and verticality (archers on balconies). Possibly
incorporate the Dwemer machinery aspect: pipes that hiss steam, some still-functional automated
defenses (maybe a couple of dormant Dwarven automaton spheres get awakened by stray damage – because
why not have a sudden third-party enemy?). If that happens, those automata attack indiscriminately (both
sides). PCs can choose to turn that to advantage (lure Imperials into a trap with an angry automaton) or
shut them down to protect everyone. A scholarly PC might recall a shut-off lever in Understone Keep’s
museum (leading them to dash there under fire to pull it). 
Major Beats:
- Jarl Igmund and Family Evacuating: The young Jarl Igmund (Imperial loyalist) might attempt to flee to
the Keep’s secret exit if defeat seems imminent. If PCs intercept him, they can capture rather than kill him
(Ulfric would likely prefer capturing Jarls to show legitimacy, except Ulfric’s known to execute some – he
executed Torygg earlier in the war). This could be a tense negotiation: Igmund yields if assured his people
won’t be harmed. Or if the PCs have a grudge (maybe Igmund’s father betrayed them in the past), they
might duel him. Keep in mind his replacement if removed is Thongvor Silver-Blood, a Stormcloak supporter .
The Silver-Blood family might even aid the Stormcloaks from within : if a PC made contact with Thongvor or
his brother Thonar , they might betray Igmund mid-battle (e.g., Silver-Blood thugs attack the city guards
from behind at a critical moment, turning the tide). In that case, Markarth falls faster (the Silver-Bloods
essentially stage a coup). This moral complication – working with a ruthless family of crime lords – can be
noted by PCs. Maven Black-Briar and the Silver-Bloods are somewhat parallels in corruption on SC side.

- The Cidhna Mine : Markarth’s prison, full of Forsworn captives. During the fight, either due to sabotage or
the PCs’ choice, the mine’s gates might be opened. If Forsworn prisoners pour out, chaos ensues. They’ll
attack Nord soldiers and maybe even Stormcloaks. It might benefit short-term (distracting the city guard),
but long-term it’s another wild card. A PC might run to Cidhna Mine to keep those prisoners locked until
after the battle (especially if they promised a truce with Forsworn – you wouldn’t want newly freed angry
Forsworn in the middle of your victory). Alternatively, freeing them could be used as a tactic if the
Stormcloaks are struggling – turn the prisoners loose as extra fighters. Present this choice if possible.
- Daedric Artifact in Markarth : Markarth houses the Shrine of Talos (where Eltrys in game meets you) and
that abandoned house (Molag Bal’s shrine). If a fight spills into the Talos shrine, perhaps a Stormcloak (with
Talos amulet) gains a Boost “Blessing of Talos” from the sacred aura, inspiring them. Conversely, if they
chase some cultist into the abandoned house, a sudden supernatural event could happen (like the doors
slam and a disembodied voice of Molag Bal taunts them). This might be foreshadowing for Act III if Molag
Bal will have a role (maybe not, but it’s a creepy Easter egg for Elder Scrolls fans). It can simply set tone of
Markarth’s haunted past. 
Climax of Siege: Likely, the final holdout is Understone Keep , the palace. The last Imperial defenders (and/
or city guards who remain loyal to Igmund) barricade the huge Dwemer doors. The PCs and Stormcloak
elites must push in. This could be resolved by either a negotiation (maybe an overwhelmed steward opens
the gates to avoid bloodshed in the sacred keep) or by a forceful assault. Understone Keep interior is vast,
with the Dwarven museum and the Jarl’s throne area . A boss fight idea: The Imperials activate a
Dwarven Centurion (giant automaton) as a last ditch defense. The PCs then face this steam-belching giant.
They might have to lure it under a collapsing pillar or hit it with shock magic to disable. While that
rampages, Jarl Igmund either flees or fights from his throne dais with his personal guard. Eventually, the
centurion collapses with a thud, and the Stormcloak banner is raised in the Keep. Markarth falls to Ulfric’s
cause. 
Aftermath (Stormcloak success): Ulfric will install Thongvor Silver-Blood as Jarl , unless the PCs did
something radical like insisted on someone else. Thongvor , gruff and satisfied, thanks the PCs: “You’ll never
pay for a drink in Markarth again, mark my words.” However , those more virtuous PCs may note: the Silver-
Bloods are basically crime lords. Markarth’s “liberation” might just hand it from one tyrant to another . This is
great fodder for moral conflict . For instance, if a PC is from Markarth and hates the Silver-Blood oppression,
how do they reconcile helping them to power? That could be compelled for inner turmoil or argument with
Ulfric’s decisions. Ulfric might argue pragmatically: “Thongvor’s support was vital. We all must make
sacrifices.” Fate Point opportunity for the conflicted. 
Also, by now, the PCs almost certainly see patterns: Whiterun’s siege was costly, Markarth’s siege too – each
time, there were strange undercurrents (Forsworn, possibly Thalmor hints). Perhaps they discuss among
themselves how every hold has some dark secret or conflict fanning the flames . If one PC has high Lore or a
knack for conspiracy, they might even suspect the Thalmor involvement behind these consistent troubles
(the GM can feed them an intuition). They may not act on it yet, but the idea is planted. 
Alternate Outcome (Stormcloaks fail at Markarth): Should the players utterly fail, maybe reinforcements
from High Rock relieve Markarth or the Forsworn disrupt the Stormcloaks fatally. This is unlikely unless by
GM design, as losing two big battles in a row would probably end the rebellion. But one can salvage a
partial failure: e.g., Stormcloaks take Markarth but Ulfric’s beloved second Galmar dies in combat, making it
a pyrrhic victory (affecting morale). Or they fail to get inside initially and have to retreat from the first25

attempt – meaning Act III might include a second attempt or a shift of strategy. In general, assume their
momentum carries, but calibrate difficulty so wins are earned but not impossible. 
Imperial Campaign – “Operation Shadowfang” (Crushing the Rift Rebellion)
Setting the Stage (Imperial context): Meanwhile, on the Imperial side in Act II, General Tullius isn’t idle.
With Whiterun secured for the Empire (assuming that Act I outcome), Tullius decides to press the advantage
into the rebel holds. He plans a major push into The Rift – the southeastern hold containing Riften , long a
Stormcloak-aligned city (Jarl Laila Law-Giver supports Ulfric ). The Rift is strategically important as it
borders Cyrodiil and Morrowind, potentially allowing Ulfric to get outside help or escape routes. Taking
Riften would cut off Stormcloak resource lines (and give the Empire control of that region’s rich resources
like timber and Nightshade). Tullius codenames the plan “Operation Shadowfang” – since the Rift’s terrain
is forested and often shrouded in mist, and perhaps referencing the need to quietly neutralize Riften’s
infamous criminal networks that could bite the Empire from the shadows. The PCs, given their performance
at Whiterun, are key operatives in this plan. Legate Rikke (Tullius’s Nord deputy) will likely coordinate this
offensive, and might personally accompany part of it. 
Operation Goals: Seize Fort Greenwall (a fort north of Riften) to stage troops, then assault Riften City .
Additionally, neutralize the Thieves Guild and Black-Briar influence in Riften that might undermine
Imperial authority. Maven Black-Briar , a powerful Riften noble, is actually pro-Empire (she stands to become
Jarl if the Empire wins ), but she’s self-serving. Meanwhile, Riften is home to the Thieves Guild and maybe
a hidden Dark Brotherhood contact – lots of underworld activity. The Empire might actually strike a deal
with Maven to betray the Stormcloak Jarl from within, but they need to ensure the city’s criminal element
doesn’t cause chaos during the attack. The PCs could be tasked with something unique: Make contact with
Maven or infiltrate the Thieves Guild to either secure their cooperation or sabotage them before the siege. 
Scene 1 (Imperial): Ambush at Fort Greenwall
Imperial scouts report that Fort Greenwall is held by a strong Stormcloak garrison blocking the road to
Riften. Rikke decides on a two-prong approach: one force will attack the fort’s front as a diversion, while a
second (led by the PCs) sneaks through Shadowgreen Cave (a known nearby cave/tunnel) to emerge inside
or behind the fort. This uses stealth and cunning – an Imperial specialty over Stormcloak brute force. The
goal is to open the gates from inside or cause confusion so the main force can take the fort with minimal
losses. 
Cave Infiltration Challenge: The PCs navigate Shadowgreen Cave (or a similar cavern). It’s dark, filled with
bioluminescent fungi – an Aspect “Gloomy Bioluminescence” which can either help (dim light, easier to
hide) or hinder (weird glowing mushrooms that might react to movement). Inside lurk either wild animals or
perhaps a band of Skyrim’s creatures – e.g., a cave bear or a troll. The PCs can choose to eliminate these
quietly or avoid them. A fun bit: maybe the cave connects to Skyrim’s famous Dwemer ruins a bit – like
they find an old Dwemer steam pipe that leads under the fort. They might need to solve a minor puzzle to
open a maintenance grate (Craft or Lore roll to manipulate Dwemer mechanism). If the players fancy a
fight, toss in a Frostbite Spider lair – thematically in a shadowy operation, spiders are apt. Killing them
quickly without noise is key to remain undetected. 
They emerge at night behind Fort Greenwall’s walls. Rain begins (Aspect “Pouring Rain and Mud” ). They
see Stormcloak sentries on the ramparts, but the main attention is facing the road where Rikke’s frontal
assault is beginning (distant sounds of clamor). The PCs must act fast: either open the fort’s gate or26
27
20


---

## Page 21

sabotage something. Perhaps they split: one group to the gate winch, another to eliminate the commander .
Set up zones in the fort: courtyard (with barracks and stables), walls, gatehouse, inner keep. 
Using stealth, the PCs could knife a few guards (Fate note: you can treat mooks as one-roll minions or
challenges to overcome quietly). If they get spotted too early, an alarm sounds and they’ll have to fight a full
garrison at once – not impossible but tough. Ideally, they time opening the gate as Rikke’s troops charge.
That triggers a big melee where PCs have allies flooding in. They might then duel the Stormcloak fort
commander , a brutish Nord nicknamed “ Hulking Harrald ” or such, on the battlements. Show his
perspective: he’s been expecting this, and curses the Empire’s trickery when he sees the gate inexplicably
open. Possibly he tries to collapse the tunnel or blow the ammo cache as a last resort; PCs might stop him. 
A complication to introduce: The fort’s storeroom has caged wolves (for war) – during battle, those get
loose (perhaps a stray fire sets them free). Now wolves are attacking indiscriminately. This chaos can be
compelled onto someone (maybe a PC with “Fear of Animals” or just as environment causing harm). PCs
could try to calm or corner wolves (Animal Handling type overcome). Or leave them – they might end up
mauling a fleeing Stormcloak, which is both brutal and telling of war’s unpredictability. 
Victory at Fort Greenwall is likely. Imperial flag replaces bear flag on fort. Legate Rikke congratulates PCs,
possibly with a grim nod: “This was well executed. We’ll make proper soldiers of you lot yet.” One PC maybe
thinks, “We already are, Legate,” if they’re career soldiers – some banter . They also find useful intel here:
perhaps a letter from Ulfric to Jarl Laila in Riften saying help is on the way, etc. Or a Thalmor dossier (if a
Justiciar was liaising with Stormcloaks here) but that might be too revealing too soon. Maybe not yet.
Instead, maybe an captured Stormcloak mutters “Damn those elves in their embassy… This is all because of
them.” If pressed, he drunkenly rants that the Thalmor wanted this war . Planting seeds. 
Side Plot B – “Underbelly of Riften” (Thieves Guild and Black-Briar Intrigue):
Before or during the siege of Riften, the PCs have the chance (or order) to handle Riften’s internal snake pit.
Riften is known for corruption. Maven Black-Briar effectively runs the economy, and the Thieves Guild
operates out of the Ratway undercity. Additionally, the Dark Brotherhood might have a small presence
(perhaps merely hinted at by the mysterious cemetery door of the Nightingale Hall or something – but
that’s more Thieves Guild/Beyond scope). The Thalmor interest here: likely minimal direct, but in a chaotic
siege, thieves could loot everything or cause civilian harm, which again drags things out. Actually, a cunning
Thalmor might have bribed the Thieves Guild to take certain actions (like steal an important artifact or
sabotage the city’s defense from within) to ensure maximum confusion. Alternatively, the Thieves Guild
might just see opportunity. Maven, being pro-Imperial, might attempt to bring Riften to capitulation with
minimal fight – if she can quietly oust Jarl Laila or incapacitate her guards, the city could fall with less blood.
The PCs might be her instruments or her rivals in this. 
Approaches: - Diplomacy/Bribery: Tullius instructs the PCs: “Contact Maven Black-Briar; assure her if she
helps us, she will remain in power .” The PCs meet Maven perhaps in secret at The Bee and Barb inn,
upstairs. She’s a shrewd, intimidating woman (Aspect “Riften’s Real Power” ). She doesn’t need persuading
to side with the winning team, but she does demand promises: e.g., the Empire will ignore certain…
“businesses” of hers. If the PCs give too much, they risk enabling a tyrant after war . If they press her , she can
threaten to withhold her help (which means a tougher fight for Riften). Ideally they strike a deal: Maven will
ensure the city guard captain (who is on her payroll) orders a stand-down at critical moment, and in return
the PCs vow that Maven will indeed be Jarl and her family privileges protected. Fate-wise, this might give
them an Aspect “Maven’s Secret Support” to invoke during the battle (e.g., one round the city guard
21


---

## Page 22

doesn’t shoot because of her orders). But later , if they go back on the deal, Maven will become an enemy.
- Thieves Guild infiltration: The PCs (particularly a stealthy or criminal-background one) might choose to
talk to or neutralize the Thieves Guild. Maybe Brynjolf or Vex from the Guild greet them in the Ragged
Flagon: “Well, if it isn’t the mighty heroes. We’ve no quarrel with you lot. We just want to make some coin
out of this mess.” The guild might actually be convinced to cooperate for a price – e.g., ensure minimal
harm to civilians or not sabotage the gates. Or the PCs could sabotage the guild themselves – e.g., flood the
Ratway (perhaps break the cistern gates, causing water to rush in). That might incapacitate some thieves
temporarily. Or they arrest the guild leader (though that’s hard; these are slippery folk).
- Dark Brotherhood cameo: If any PC is of the Brotherhood or they have interacted before, Riften’s
graveyard could host a hooded “friend”. Possibly the Brotherhood was hired to kill either Maven (by
Stormcloak sympathizers who hate her) or Jarl Laila (by Maven herself or Thalmor stirring pot). The PCs
might stumble upon an assassination attempt mid-siege: an assassin aims for Laila Law-Giver as the walls
are breached. Do they let it happen (makes conquest easier but a dishonorable murder)? Or stop it? This
can be a brief but dramatic scene. If a PC is pro-DB, they might even be the assassin’s ally or competitor . 
Main idea: By addressing these underworld elements, the PCs can reduce Riften’s resistance or collateral
damage. If they succeed, when the main battle comes, perhaps the city yields faster – e.g., half the city
guard simply doesn’t fight (Maven’s influence), making the PC’s job easier . If they fail or ignore it, Riften’s
defense is stiff and chaotic: thieves might take up arms against everyone (imagine them looting during fire,
or the guild setting parts of city on fire to cover escapes). That could ironically hamper the Imperials (fire
spreads beyond control). 
Scene 2 (Imperial): The Battle for Riften – Lions at the Gate
Now the culmination: With Fort Greenwall taken, Imperial forces march on Riften . Riften sits on Lake
Honrich, with high walls. The Imperial plan likely involves an frontal assault on the main gate (guarded by a
drawbridge over the canal) while possibly a small force swims the lake to come from the docks side. PCs
could choose either approach. 
Phase 1: Storming the Gate. If Maven/guard collusion is in play, maybe the drawbridge is lowered at an
opportune time, suspiciously easily. If not, PCs might have to lower it under fire (climb the wall or find the
mechanism via the canal). Perhaps they sneak a couple of soldiers via sewer to pop up and open the gates.
A famous TES reference: Maul , Maven’s thug, could double-cross someone – maybe he was paid by Ulfric to
actually lock the gates and hold Maven hostage if she tried betrayal. The PCs might catch him at the winch
trying to keep it shut. A quick fight with Maul (Aspect “Thug with a Vengeance” ) and they toss him off the
rampart, and then the gates open. 
Phase 2: City fight. Riften’s narrower than Whiterun/Markarth, mostly a big plaza (the market) and
surrounding lanes. The central market becomes a battlefield. The unique environment here: canal
boardwalks and a honeycomb of wooden houses (risk of fire). The Temple of Mara’s bells ring in alarm.
Stormcloak archers on rooftops, maybe the Riften Fishery workers joining to fight off invaders with fishing
spears (loyal to their Jarl). The Imperials push in phalanx style. The PCs probably carve a path to Mistveil
Keep (Jarl’s palace at city’s end). 
Notable NPCs in battle:
- Jarl Laila Law-Giver – A decent but not extraordinary leader . She might rally a last stand at the Keep, or if
Maven’s coup happens, she might be found wounded or locked up before PCs even arrive (Maven’s doing).
The PCs then deal with Maven or her personal mercenaries inside (Maven might try to claim credit: “I’ve
22


---

## Page 23

saved you the trouble; Riften is yours. Now honor our arrangement.”).
- Maven’s son, Hemming Black-Briar might lead some house guards either to help Imperials or if upset by
invasion, even fight them (if they double-cross Maven).
- The Thieves Guild mostly stays hidden. But one thief named Brynjolf might take this chance to pickpocket a
PC mid-fight for fun – up to you for a light moment (“really, during a war?!”). 
Side encounter: The Ratway . At some point a fire or collapse might open a hole into the Ratway.
Perhaps fleeing Stormcloaks hide there. PCs could pursue in the dark tunnels and find themselves
ambushed by desperate stragglers or thieves. It’s a moody aside – torchlit brick corridors, dripping
water. They might also discover evidence of a Skooma lab** (indicating Riften’s drug trade). They could
destroy it (which scores points with law-abiding citizens but maybe annoys Maven who profits from it if
allied). 
Climax at Mistveil Keep: The final confrontation occurs in the Jarl’s throne room. If Laila is present with her
housecarl and a few staunch Stormcloaks, she’ll refuse to surrender until pressed. Possibly Legate Rikke
joins the PCs here to accept her surrender or fight. If Maven orchestrated things, maybe the PCs arrive to
find Laila already deposed and Maven sitting coolly on the throne with a Black-Briar banner . That’s eerie for
them: they essentially traded an overt Stormcloak for a subtle tyrant. Possibly Rikke disapproves but
pragmatically accepts. 
Outcome (Imperial victory): Riften falls, the Imperial Dragon banner raised over Mistveil Keep. Jarl Laila (if
alive) is exiled or imprisoned. Maven Black-Briar is installed as Jarl (she will indeed in canon if Imperials
take Riften ). There’s no joyous celebration from citizens – Riften’s folk are sullen and fearful (they traded
one set of masters for another perhaps). PCs might feel that moral gray. However , strategically it’s a big win:
the Empire now controls the south-east. 
Legate Rikke thanks them, maybe a bit somberly: “We did what we had to. The Rift is ours. Talos guide those
who fell today.” She might quietly caution a PC she trusts: “Keep an eye on Maven. The Empire may need
her , but I fear what Skyrim will become under such people.” Hinting that victory could be hollow if it
empowers corrupt figures – reflecting the theme of costs of war .
Alternate outcome (Imperial fail at Riften): If Stormclaw reinforcements arrived or the PCs didn’t
neutralize the guild and got overwhelmed, maybe the Imperials have to retreat from a botched first assault.
They could try again later or shift to another target (like attempt Winterhold or something). But likely with
PC heroics, Riften will fall to them. If something like Maven betraying them happened, that could cause
fiasco: e.g., Maven double-crosses and at last moment swings city guard back to Stormcloak side, surprising
the Imperials and repelling them. That’s dramatic but maybe too early for such a twist; maybe save double-
cross for later story if at all. 
Act II Resolution:
By the end of Act II, each faction’s campaign likely succeeded in capturing key cities: Stormcloaks took
Markarth (and perhaps Falkreath or others in interim), Imperials took Riften (and likely Dawnstar or
Winterhold next, which could be off-screen or quick missions if needed). The map of Skyrim is now heavily
in each side’s favor in different regions. Only the final strongholds remain: Solitude for the Empire,
Windhelm for the Stormcloaks – setting the stage for Act III/IV ultimate confrontations. But more
importantly, through Act II’s side plots, the PCs have encountered multiple instances of covert interference :
Forsworn chaos, Daedric cults, criminal factions – all seemingly independent but each conveniently fueling26
23


---

## Page 24

disorder . Patterns start emerging. The Thalmor presence hasn’t been loudly revealed, but keen players
should suspect their influence after reading documents or hearing rumors at least . 
Allow a breather scene after the dust settles. Perhaps a war council meeting for each side to plan the next
act, where PCs can voice concerns. For Stormcloaks: Ulfric might be buoyant after Markarth, planning to
move on Solitude . For Imperials: Tullius, proud of Riften’s fall, eyes Windhelm next. Both sides likely
consider Winterhold or Dawnstar minor mop-ups if not done (they might delegate those to secondary
forces or quick treaties – e.g., Winterhold’s pro-Stormcloak Jarl could capitulate if isolated). 
Crucially, seed Act III by having NPCs bring news of strange occurrences: maybe reports from Dawnstar of
mass nightmares (Vaermina’s doing), or Winterhold of magical anomalies near the College, or Falkreath of
a plague of undeath (vampire or undead stirring, maybe due to the war causing neglected graves). These
are hooks for Act III’s more supernatural/dark elements. They underscore that the war is unleashing or
coinciding with other evils – which a perceptive character might link to “someone taking advantage of the
chaos.” Indeed, the Thalmor or even Daedric Princes are exploiting Skyrim’s turmoil. 
Transition to Act III will involve tackling some of these internal crises, character development (especially for
Hadvar and Ralof), and possibly a temporary lull in direct military campaigns (maybe a truce or stalemate
occurs as both sides lick wounds), giving room for more investigative and character-driven stories. Little do
the factions know, the Thalmor’s grand scheme is inching toward fruition in the background, ready to be
unveiled in Act IV. The players’ actions in Act II—whom they allied with, what compromises they accepted—
will have ripple effects felt in the next acts, both narratively and via aspects (e.g., “Maven’s Pocket Empire”
in Riften or “Forsworn Resurgence” in the Reach could be aspects to invoke/compel later). 
With Act II done, the stage is set: Skyrim is bloodied and weary, victories have been won but at moral costs,
and ominous shadows loom behind the scenes. Act III will delve into those shadows, pushing the PCs to
confront the heart of darkness within their own factions and the land itself, before the final confrontation
with the puppet-masters fueling this war . 
Act III: The Shadow War – Subterfuge and Sorcery Amid Conflict
Summary: Act III shifts focus from open battlefronts to the hidden and psychological dimensions of the
war . With each side holding significant territory, the civil war enters a phase of attrition, espionage, and
internal strife. This Act is about the “war in the shadows” – uncovering Thalmor plots, dealing with Daedric
meddling directly, and resolving personal vendettas. The PCs will likely undertake missions that involve
infiltration, investigation, and confronting creeping darkness within Skyrim’s society and even within
themselves. Major NPC arcs move toward resolution here: Hadvar and Ralof each face intense personal
tests that reflect the war’s toll on identity and loyalty. Act III’s climax might not be a grand battle, but rather
a turning point revelation – the discovery of the Thalmor’s grand interference (or at least undeniable
proof of it) and perhaps a moment where PCs can influence their leaders’ recognition of the true enemy.
The end of Act III likely sees the war approaching its final act – with possibly a pause or uneasy truce as
both sides grapple with revelations, setting the stage for Act IV’s endgame. 
By now, thematic stakes are high: players should feel the weight of patriotism vs. conscience, see Nords
on both sides questioning themselves, and sense tragedy in every victory. This Act is structured around key12
24

## Page 25

events in a few cities and locations: Dawnstar’s nightmare curse , Winterhold’s magical crisis , a possible
peace negotiation at High Hrothgar (optional but a classic scenario reminiscent of Skyrim’s “Season
Unending” conference quest), and the personal side-stories culminating for Ralof and Hadvar . Branching
paths are significant here: players might push for a temporary ceasefire to deal with a greater threat (e.g. a
Daedric monster or a Thalmor assassin targeting both sides’ leaders), or they might double-down on
partisanship until the Thalmor’s hand forces an unlikely cooperation. GM should be flexible – Act III could
even allow a scenario where, say, Stormcloak and Imperial PC groups (if the party was split by perspective
earlier) finally intersect and could choose to either clash or collaborate against a revealed third-party
threat. 
We’ll break Act III into several scenario segments: 
Scene 1: The Dreams of the Pale (Dawnstar’s Nightmare)
In the northern coastal town of Dawnstar (the Pale’s capital), an uncanny affliction strikes: everyone is
plagued by unending nightmares , leaving the garrison and civilians exhausted and paranoid . This is
the setup of the Skyrim quest “Waking Nightmare” (Vaermina’s artifact, the Skull of Corruption). In our
campaign, whichever faction holds Dawnstar now (initially Stormcloaks under Jarl Skald, but it could have
switched to Imperials under Brina Merilis if Imperials took the Pale in Act II) – the problem affects all
equally, an opportunity for a side ceasefire . For instance, if Imperials control Dawnstar , Jarl Brina (an ex-
Legionnaire, pragmatic) might ask Stormcloak prisoners or contacts for help if they have a clue; or vice versa,
Stormcloak Jarl Skald might grudgingly welcome any help including from an Imperial envoy because he
sees it as a curse likely sent by elves or something. The PCs, if nearby or notified, are asked to investigate as
this could be either a Thalmor trick or a genuine Daedric curse threatening to sideline an entire hold’s
contribution to the war . 
Investigation: Arriving in Dawnstar , the PCs find a bleak scene. Men with red-rimmed eyes wander like
living ghosts. Miners too scared to enter the mines (they “saw things” in the dark). The local priest of Mara,
Erandur (if using game NPC, a reformed Vaermina cultist) seeks help to end this curse . He explains
it’s Vaermina’s doing – a Daedric Prince of nightmares . The source is the Nightcaller Temple on the hill,
an old abandoned monastery where Vaermina’s Skull of Corruption artifact resides, polluting dreams. He’s
tried to form a small band to go dispel it, but needs protection. The PCs likely accept (both out of heroism
and pragmatic need: a whole hold’s soldiers ineffective = weakness to enemy). This can be a classic
dungeon crawl horror scene . 
Nightcaller Temple Dungeon: Inside the temple, which is an old fort, they face magical traps causing
hallucinations (Aspects like “Phantasmal Terror” causing Will saves or mental stress), cultist remnants or
manifestations (maybe dream-induced specters of past Orc invaders that fought here in lore). The goal is to
reach the inner sanctum and destroy or seal the Skull. Use Fate challenges: e.g., a mental conflict where
each PC experiences their worst fear as an illusion. You can personalize: maybe Hadvar sees Helgen’s
dragon fire again, immobilizing him until a PC snaps him out; Ralof might see Imperial torturers; a PC mage
might see themselves losing control of magic etc. They overcome by clever roleplay or resisting with Will. At
the climax, maybe a mini-boss: A Vaermina Devotee (possibly the entity of a former priest possessed by
the Skull’s power) fights them, using mind-control attempts (could temporarily turn a PC against others – a
compel on an Aspect like “Susceptible to mind tricks” if any, or just a temporary Aspect “Dominated by
Nightmares” on a PC to overcome to act freely). Eventually, Erandur and PCs perform a ritual to nullify the
Skull – or if PCs are greedy, they might be tempted to take the Skull artifact (dangerous, as it allows28

siphoning dreams at cost of corruption). The likely righteous path is destroying it, freeing Dawnstar from
the curse . Dawnstar’s people immediately start to sleep better; morale restored. The Jarl (Skald or Brina)
thanks them. 
Impact: If Stormcloak and Imperial players/groups are separate, this quest is a great neutral ground to
have them cooperate briefly. Maybe Tullius and Ulfric agreed that Dawnstar’s nightmare needed solving
and allowed a joint task force (the PCs from each side). After working together in a dark dungeon, even
bitter enemies might gain respect. Use this to build Ralof and Hadvar’s personal camaraderie if possible –
maybe they were uneasy allies here and saved each other’s lives from a terror demon. That can deepen
their arcs (especially if in Act IV they need to possibly broker peace). Reward the party with a boon: perhaps
a rare alchemical ingredient from Vaermina’s realm that Erandur gives (mechanically could allow a one-
time create advantage “Dreamstride Vision” to be used later for insight). Also, a Fate Point refresh could
narratively occur after this cathartic win. 
Importantly, in investigating the temple’s history or Erandur’s notes, the PCs find references that the
Vaermina cult initially grew strong because the Orc chieftain of the Great War (a historical event) had
collaborated to attack Dawnstar , implying external influences sowing nightmares to weaken the hold even
back then. This parallels current events – a subtle sign that someone always tries to weaken Skyrim
through its own fears . Hmm. 
Scene 2: The High King’s Ghost (Windhelm’s Racial Tensions and “Blood on the Ice”)
Switching to Eastmarch and Windhelm , especially if Imperials are about to attack it or if Stormcloaks still
hold it but are troubled internally. Windhelm’s known issue: the serial killer (“Blood on the Ice” quest in
game) targeting young women in the city, and the simmering racism towards Dunmer in the Grey Quarter .
If Imperials hold most of Skyrim except Windhelm, maybe some in Windhelm think of surrender; if
Stormcloaks still hold, maybe morale is shaky hearing of Ulfric’s conquests stalled or reversed. In either
case, a specter from the past arises: a murderer known as the Butcher strikes in Windhelm’s streets, killing
locals (likely Nords but in game it was young women, possibly of various races). The twist: The murderer is
Calixto (an old man with a necromantic obsession, in game), trying to reassemble his dead sister’s body.
But I propose adding a thematic angle: he is also spurred by the unrest – maybe he explicitly targets those
who “consort with the enemy” (if Stormcloak, he kills a Nord girl seen talking to an Imperial; if Imperial, he
kills someone collaborating with occupying forces). So his insanity gets a political tinge. 
The PCs could be drawn in if in Windhelm (either because they are there for talks, or infiltrating, or
stationed). For Stormcloak PCs, Ulfric might quietly ask them to solve it because it’s scaring citizens (and he
doesn’t want to seem incapable). For Imperial PCs if they just captured Windhelm in Act IV, maybe this
occurs during occupation – a killer undermining their ‘liberation’ by causing chaos, perhaps a Thalmor
leftover? So either timeline it fits: presumably Act III likely before final battle at Windhelm, when tension is
high. 
Investigation: They examine crime scenes (using Investigation skill). Clues: strange amulets, butcher’s
journals referencing “the power of King’s flesh” – maybe he imagines resurrecting High King Torygg (weird
twist: what if he’s trying to assemble the dead High King that Ulfric killed, thinking to create a ghostly
claimant to scare Ulfric? That’s one way to incorporate “High King’s ghost”). This is optional but adds mythic
feel: some citizens claim to see Torygg’s ghost wandering the city at night, moaning. It could just be Calixto31

in a cloak with an illusion. Or perhaps Vaermina’s leftover magic causing apparitions from trauma (Ulfric’s
shout death of Torygg left a spiritual scar?). PCs must decipher reality. 
Confrontation: They likely corner Calixto in the Candlehearth Hall or in his House of Curiosities. If Hadvar is
around (Imperial), he might be especially invested – one victim could be someone he knew from childhood
(maybe a cousin in Windhelm). If Ralof is present (Stormcloak), maybe he’s frustrated that Windhelm,
supposed safe capital, is as dangerous as warfront. They capture or kill Calixto. On him they find something
interesting: a Butcher’s journal detailing how he acquired a necromantic tome from a “hooded Altmer”
weeks ago that taught him life-extending rituals. Aha – possibly a Thalmor agent manipulated him (Thalmor
loves sowing fear in Windhelm to weaken Ulfric’s base). This is a direct piece of evidence of Thalmor
interference . It names no names, but description matches a known Thalmor emissary (perhaps one they
met earlier , like that Justiciar in Markarth or Elenwen’s subordinate). PCs get this clue. 
Also, this scenario addresses Windhelm’s prejudice: maybe during investigation a Dunmer woman is falsely
accused (similar to game, where they suspect Wuunferth the court mage). PCs can choose to defend the
innocent. If Ralof’s around, this could be pivotal for him – seeing a Dunmer treated unjustly in “his” city
might stir empathy or conflict with his worldview. It plays into his arc (possibly realizing what Ulfric ignored).
In the end, solving the murders calms Windhelm’s populace somewhat, and if Stormcloak side, Ulfric
publicly thanks them (or privately acknowledges it). Perhaps he reassigns some guards to better protect the
Grey Quarter now (inspired by PC’s insistence). It’s minor but meaningful change. If Imperial side (taking
city) and they solve it, it helps win trust of Windhelm citizens a bit (the invaders stopped a killer where
Ulfric’s regime didn’t). That could reflect hearts-and-minds aspect. 
Scene 3: Council of Heroes (The High Hrothgar Truce Negotiation) – Optional Heavy
Roleplay Scene
This scene is a homage to the “Season Unending” peace council in Skyrim’s main quest , which might
occur if the war stalemates or the PCs push for it upon realizing the Thalmor threat. It is Act III’s dramatic
centerpiece for politics and character confrontation. 
Setup: The idea can arise that the civil war is exhausting both sides with Alduin gone, maybe some voices
(like Arngeir of the Greybeards, or General Rikke if Imperial, or Jarl Elisif if Stormcloak side is winning and
she’s captive, etc.) call for a temporary ceasefire to discuss terms or at least prisoner exchange. Perhaps
more pressingly, news of a possible Thalmor incursion or conspiracy freaks out someone in power enough
to agree to talk. For example, after seeing enough evidence (like Butcher’s journal, Forsworn indirect aid,
Dawnstar nightmares clearly magical interference), General Tullius and Ulfric Stormcloak could be
convinced (by the PCs or their advisors) to send envoys to a neutral parley – likely at High Hrothgar , home
of the Greybeards, who in lore brokered the ceasefire once . The Greybeards (or just Arngeir) invite the
leaders under the ancient rule of peace on sacred ground. The PCs might accompany their respective leader
as part of the delegation (indeed, they may be recognized as instrumental heroes whose words carry
weight). 
Council Dynamics: Present are Ulfric and Galmar (Stormcloak), Tullius and Rikke (Imperial), possibly Elisif
(to speak for Solitude if Tullius insists) and perhaps an advisor like Elenwen the Thalmor ambassador tries to
attend (in the game she does, which was controversial). Actually, yes, having a Thalmor representative
Elenwen present will really spark drama – and give the PCs a chance to expose or confront her . Arngeir3233

## Page 28

moderates, expecting civil discussion. But bitterness runs high: Ulfric might immediately taunt Elisif about
her slain husband, Tullius might call Ulfric a murderer , etc. The system can be run as a social conflict or
contest, where each side has “demands” to trade. In the game, they traded holds to balance. Here, maybe
things like: Ulfric wants Empire to withdraw from the Reach and Markarth; Tullius wants Ulfric to cease Talos
rhetoric in exchange for a ceasefire, etc. The PCs can intervene to sway arguments with Diplomacy,
Intimidation (a loud Thu’um shout to silence bickering maybe, if a PC has Voice powers). 
Key moment – Thalmor Reveal: During talks, one agenda item: evidence of Thalmor interference. The PCs
(assuming they have collected proof pieces) can lay them out on the negotiation table. For example: “We
have here a dossier from a Thalmor operative that none of you have seen – it calls Ulfric an ‘uncooperative
asset’ and explicitly says the Thalmor benefit from this war .” That is explosive. Ulfric, furious, denies
being anyone’s asset – but the evidence is strong (maybe signed by Elenwen). Tullius is grim as he reads it –
he mutters that his suspicions were right. If Elenwen is present, she’ll try to dismiss it as forgery, but her
facade cracks (maybe sweat). A PC with Insight can call out her lie. If cornered, she might lash verbally: “It’s
true. We did everything short of gutting your leaders ourselves to keep this conflict alive – and you fools
played into our hands!” Possibly she reveals too much if villainously monologuing – and tries to storm out
or call backup. Ulfric might roar in rage and attempt to physically attack Elenwen then and there. This could
escalate: if Elenwen had hidden guards outside, a brief skirmish could break out (the truce nearly
collapsing ). PCs must decide – do they protect Elenwen from Ulfric’s wrath to maintain peace, or let him kill
her? If Elenwen is killed here by Ulfric or someone, that’s one Thalmor down but maybe not strategically
best – she could be more useful as a prisoner . Arngeir would be dismayed at bloodshed in High Hrothgar .
Nevertheless, this reveal should unify (at least partially) the humans against the Thalmor threat. The
ultimate theme: Maybe Nords and Imperials have more in common than they thought – a common
enemy. This doesn’t end the war automatically, but it definitely causes pause. Perhaps a temporary
armistice is agreed: e.g., a 30-day ceasefire to deal with “certain revelations.” Ulfric might not shake Tullius’s
hand, but he nods curtly, “When we resume, General, it will be with all this in light. But for now... the
Dominion has much to answer for .” Tullius begrudgingly respects Ulfric’s willingness to pause for greater
good (or sees it as chance to rearm – up to interpretation). The Greybeards praise this “first step toward true
peace,” though PCs might know true peace is far off.
Personal arc notes in council:
- Hadvar likely stands by Tullius, glaring at Ulfric (who nearly had him executed at Helgen). But after hearing
Thalmor stuff, he might swallow pride and say something like, “Sir , perhaps... this fight can wait until the
Dominion’s dealt with.” This shows his maturity – big growth from just a loyal soldier to someone who sees
bigger picture (Talos worshiper in him quietly cheering to fight Thalmor directly).
- Ralof stands by Ulfric and might call Hadvar a bootlicker at first. But when evidence of Thalmor comes, he
looks shocked, remembering Helgen too (he saw Elenwen there). He perhaps publicly apologizes to Ulfric
for doubting, but privately to a PC later admits, “I hated the Empire so much I never dreamed the real
enemy stood right beside them.” If Elenwen is still present, Ralof likely spits at her feet, uttering a curse
about avenging all murdered by Thalmor . 
Thus Act III could end either with that fragile truce or at least all sides aware of Thalmor treachery. If you
choose not to have a peace council, you can still have the evidence reveal happen via other means (like PCs
sneaking into Thalmor embassy themselves and catching evidence, culminating in a boss fight in Act IV
perhaps). But the council is a nice chance for roleplay and final venting of grievances before final battles. 3415

Regardless, by Act III’s end, the Thalmor’s covert role is definitively exposed to the PCs and likely to
leaders. The true antagonist stands revealed: the Thalmor orchestrated much of this tragedy . Now Act
IV can focus on confronting the ramifications – either the war resumes with more ferocity (but perhaps
clarity), or maybe a brief alliance of convenience happens (e.g., both sides allow the PCs to launch a joint
strike on a Thalmor target). 
Additionally, by Act III end, Hadvar and Ralof’s personal arcs hit their climax : perhaps Ralof sees Ulfric
not as infallible (maybe he’s troubled Ulfric was inadvertently used by Thalmor), and Hadvar sees the
Empire’s failings (the Concordat enabling this situation). Each considers what Skyrim truly needs. They
might voice these doubts to the PCs, each considering perhaps that victory at all costs isn’t as sweet if the
Thalmor still rule from shadows. This primes possible endings where these NPCs could make surprising
choices (like Ralof maybe prevents Ulfric from executing Elisif, or Hadvar refuses an order to kill a
surrendering Stormcloak – those could be Act IV moments). 
Give the players and their characters a moment in quiet after the council or revelations: perhaps at night on
the 7,000 steps, a PC contemplates the sky, now free of Alduin but filled with uncertainty. A perhaps
unexpected cameo: the Dragonborn themselves passes by on their way down from speaking with
Greybeards (if timeline fits) – they nod to the PCs and offer a word: “The gods gave you all a hard path. But I
have faith you’ll make the right choices for Skyrim.” This subtle blessing (call it a Dragonborn’s Blessing
aspect for final battle use) can be a neat cameo that doesn’t overshadow. Or the Dragonborn sends a gift
via Arngeir: perhaps a Horn of Calling that PC can blow once for aid (maybe summoning a dragon ally
exactly once in final battle or giving a +4 one-time).
Now the stage is set for Act IV: final battles with clearer villainy. The war might still need concluding (Ulfric
vs. Tullius, Windhelm vs. Solitude), but now the Thalmor will likely intervene directly, perhaps making a last
move to kill Ulfric or seize Skyrim’s power in the chaos. The PCs will be at the crux, deciding the war’s
outcome and dealing with the Thalmor’s endgame plan. Themes of identity and unity reach peak: will the
Nords and Empire remain divided or stand together at the eleventh hour? Act IV will answer that, shaped
strongly by all these prior acts’ choices. 
Act IV: The Final Storm – Siege of Solitude/Windhelm and The
Thalmor Gambit
Summary: Act IV is the climax of the campaign. The civil war comes to its final battle: either the
Stormcloaks’ siege of Solitude or the Imperial assault on Windhelm , depending on which side the PCs
support (or potentially both, if the party has members on each side or if a negotiation led to a joint focus
against the Thalmor; we’ll accommodate both possibilities). Parallel to this grand battle, the Thalmor
execute their endgame plan : a covert (or overt) operation to sabotage the victor and tighten Aldmeri
Dominion control over Skyrim. This could manifest as an attempted assassination of Ulfric and Tullius
both , a plan to unleash a Daedric horror during the battle, or even an effort to retrieve/destroy a significant
artifact (like the Jagged Crown or some symbol of Skyrim’s royalty) to prevent unity. The PCs must fight on
the front lines of the battle and likely break away at a critical moment to thwart the Thalmor’s scheme.
Major NPCs like Hadvar and Ralof will reach their ultimate fate or reconciliation in this Act. By the end, one
faction wins the war – but the focus is on ensuring Skyrim isn’t left vulnerable to the Thalmor in victory or21

defeat. The epilogue then ties up the PCs’ personal journeys, the political aftermath, and possibly an
appearance or acknowledgment by the Dragonborn (as a legendary figure giving them kudos or gifts). 
Structure: We will outline the final battle from both perspectives (Stormcloak attack on Solitude and
Imperial attack on Windhelm). There’s a lot of symmetry: both cities are the enemy’s capital, heavily
fortified, with the faction leader present (Ulfric in Windhelm, Tullius and Elisif in Solitude). In each case,
incorporate the third-party Thalmor interference as a timed event or clock that if not stopped could ruin
everything. The PCs will likely have to make tough choices: do they pursue the primary objective (defeating
the enemy leader) or divert to stop the Thalmor plot when it emerges? Ideally, they delegate or split party
to handle both – cinematic multitasking. Branches from Act III matter: e.g., if a truce happened, maybe an
unusual scenario occurs where some Imperials assist Stormcloaks to remove Thalmor influences in Solitude
or vice versa, at least for a crucial hour . Or if no truce, the PCs might individually choose to prioritize killing
the opposing leader or joining forces to strike the Thalmor first. The module should allow the PCs to be
heroes by making the wise call (likely foiling Thalmor plan even if it means the war outcome is slightly
altered). 
Let’s break down by perspective:
Stormcloak Path – “Battle for Solitude” & The Thalmor’s Trap
Prelude: Ulfric’s host surrounds Solitude , the great coastal capital . Solitude’s blue banners of the
Empire fly high; General Tullius commands defense from Castle Dour , and Jarl Elisif rallies what troops she
can (though her heart is heavy without her husband, Torygg). The mood is tense: Solitude expects a brutal
siege, but perhaps underestimates Ulfric’s fury after all the Thalmor revelations. Ulfric addresses his
Stormcloaks: “Today, we cast down the last puppet of the Empire, and tear out the Thalmor threat by its roots!”
He’s combining goals: He likely intends to execute General Tullius (and perhaps Elisif) to end Imperial rule,
but also has quietly told Galmar to hunt down any Thalmor agents inside the city – he’s wary of more
treachery. The PCs as his elite team are tasked with spearheading a breach and specifically to secure the
Emperor’s cousin (if she’s present, like Vittoria Vici) or any high-profile hostages – because Ulfric suspects
the Thalmor might try something with them (maybe intelligence says the Thalmor plot involves harming
such figures to prolong conflict). Essentially, Ulfric trusts the PCs now to look out for the unseen threats even
as the main force battles. Ralof is at the PC’s side, determined to see this through, but he confides privately
that this victory feels different: “I used to think it would be Sovngarde-grand. But now I just want it over so we
can deal with the real enemy.” He’s implying his hatred has shifted from Empire to Thalmor . This is huge
character growth.
Siege Start: Solitude’s main gate (at the end of a long arching bridge) is heavily defended . Catapults
from Stormcloaks bombard the walls. The initial assault is brutal: Stormcloaks push across the bridge under
withering arrow fire. The PCs can lead from the front or take a side route: maybe climbing along the rocky
sides of the arch to flank a tower (Athletics challenge, failure means a perilous dangling but maybe they
recover). They likely have to break the gate with a battering ram or explosive. If they recovered any Dwemer
tech from Markarth, now’s a time to use it (maybe they rig a repurposed ballista as a door-breaching
crossbow). They smash through and Stormcloaks flood into Solitude’s lower city (the marketplace by the
docks). Street-to-street fighting ensues. 
City Combat Highlights:
- Solitude’s layout has narrow alleys and grand plazas (the Bards College area, etc.). The Bards College35
36

## Page 31

ironically might be playing intense martial music audible even over battle – one poetic Bard decided to
score the battle. PCs could invoke “Inspirational War Ballad Echoing” for courage or distraction.
- The Blue Palace (Elisif’s palace) is on one end, Castle Dour (military HQ) on the other near the gate. Likely
Ulfric wants Tullius found in Castle Dour and Elisif in Blue Palace. They probably split forces: Galmar leads
some to Castle Dour , while PCs perhaps are sent to secure Blue Palace. Ulfric himself fights where the battle
is thickest (maybe at Castle Dour after gate, or moving between).
- Civilians : Many Solitude civilians (merchants, etc.) hide or flee to the docks. Some misguidedly take up
arms for their city (PCs might face not just soldiers but an irate shopkeeper swinging a pan – do they knock
out or kill such non-combatants? Morality test!). Possibly, remember Jarl Balgruuf and others exiled from
Whiterun are actually in Solitude’s basement if they were ousted . If Stormcloaks find them, will they
harm those refugees? PC Stormcloaks could decide to show mercy, scoring moral points. 
Thalmor Interference: At some point mid-battle, possibly when Stormcloaks seem to have the upper hand,
the Thalmor spring their trap. A few ideas:
- Assassination attempt on Ulfric: Elenwen (if not killed at the peace council or earlier) may have a last
resort plan. Example: disguised as an injured refugee, she gets close to Ulfric with a hidden dagger
envenomed in some terrible poison. A PC might notice this (“that refugee’s eyes glint with too much
hatred”) and intervene. This could be a quick time event – if they fail, Ulfric gets stabbed. Perhaps he has a
chance to survive but is weakened (taking a Severe consequence “Poisoned Wound” ). If they succeed, they
expose and stop her – maybe Ralof or PC kills Elenwen, fulfilling his vow. But if Ulfric goes down, the
Stormcloak assault falters (some might think him dead). The PCs might need to rally them (shouting “For
Ulfric, for Skyrim!” with a Leadership roll to create “Unbroken Stormcloak Morale” ). Ulfric’s survival or not
will dramatically alter ending – presumably PC will try to save him (maybe an antidote exists, could tie to
something from Vaermina’s temple that cures exotic poisons, if they got such an item).
- Summoned Creature or Daedric Beast: The Thalmor , cornered, might unleash a bound Daedra in the
streets – e.g., a Storm Atronach or even enslaved dragon (though Thalmor using a dragon might be far-
fetched, but possible through some twisted magic, or an undead dragon? That’s very high fantasy but it’s
finale!). The PCs would have to break off to fight that monster rampaging among soldiers of both sides
(again a scenario where for a moment Stormcloaks and Imperials both run from or tackle the beast). That
fight can be a set-piece: e.g., a Storm Atronach towering, hurling lightning – PCs can use environment (lead
it near wet docks then tip over metal anchor chain to short-circuit it – a clever overcome to destroy it
without direct confrontation).
- Kidnap/Hostage scenario: Perhaps Thalmor agents grab Jarl Elisif amid chaos and threaten to kill her (or
actually plan to take her to Alinor) thus depriving Skyrim of a peaceful figurehead for post-war (Thalmor
would love to martyr her to inflame Nords or , conversely, kill Ulfric to decapitate Stormcloaks). If PC
Stormcloaks come across this – do they save the Imperial Jarl? If they don’t, the Thalmor kill her – which
possibly cheats Ulfric of legitimacy (he might have wanted her to publicly yield to him to unify Skyrim). This
could also be Ralof’s arc test: He used to hate the Empire so would he care to save Elisif? Maybe yes, if he’s
grown – “She’s not our enemy, not truly.” This can be an emotional rescue scene. If saved, Elisif perhaps
yields gracefully to Ulfric after seeing Stormcloaks aren’t monsters (especially the PC actions). If not saved,
Ulfric actually might mourn in his own way (he didn’t wish her dead, in fact planned to try to marry or
negotiate with her in some fan theories). This can sow regret. 
Climax at Castle Dour/Palace: Eventually the final fight is either Ulfric vs. Tullius in Castle Dour’s war room,
or if Ulfric was incapacitated, maybe the PCs do it. Ideally, Ulfric (if alive and present) should get his
confrontation with General Tullius as in game – perhaps with PC at his side. Tullius is a seasoned fighter; he
and Ulfric duel while PC deals with Legate Rikke interfering or other guards. In a dramatic moment, Tullius32
31

## Page 32

is beaten to his knees. Ulfric either executes him or the PC can influence showing mercy. If the PC argues
for mercy (maybe citing that unity against Thalmor is needed and spilling more Imperial blood will hinder
that), Ulfric might actually listen if respect was earned. He could instead order Tullius to leave Skyrim in exile
humiliated. That drastically improves chances of reconciliation later . If the PC stays silent or agrees with
Ulfric’s vengeance, Ulfric likely has Ralof execute Tullius with the axe (or does it himself if he wasn’t
wounded). This fulfills the Stormcloak ambition but leaves a bitter note. Either way, that effectively ends
organized Imperial resistance. Elisif’s fate: if alive and present, Ulfric might spare her (especially if PC
encouraged mercy) and even allow her to remain Jarl of Solitude under him (which in UESP note he does to
legitimize his rule ). If she died by Thalmor , Ulfric appoints someone (maybe PC, if a noble or such? Or
keeps Elisif’s steward Falk Firebeard to ease transition). This could be player’s decision if they have influence
– maybe they ensure a stable, fair person gets the role. 
Stormcloak Victory Epilogue: Ulfric Stormcloak is now High King of Skyrim (by right of conquest). The war
is won. There’s jubilation among Stormcloaks, yet also tremendous rebuilding and mending to do. Ulfric
addresses the crowd in Solitude’s plaza: “We have thrown off the yoke of the Empire! But our true enemy
remains – we shall ready ourselves for the day the Dominion comes for us. By Shor , they will find us united!”
– This sets stage for future struggle vs Thalmor . He thanks the PCs individually, perhaps offering them titles
(Thanehood in a hold, or even governorship of a hold that lost its Jarl). E.g., if PC is a Nord of good standing,
Ulfric might name them Jarl of Whiterun or even give them an heirloom weapon (War Axe of Eastmarch,
etc.). 
Ralof’s arc ends with him somewhat somber amid victory – he likely visits the graves of fallen friends
(maybe Laila or Galmar if they died) and vows to ensure their sacrifice isn’t wasted by falling for Thalmor
tricks again. He possibly accepts a promotion (maybe becomes Ulfric’s new general now that Galmar might
have died or retired). Alternatively, if Ulfric was gravely poisoned and perhaps needs time to heal, Ralof
could step up as an acting leader in interim or support whoever Ulfric picks. Ralof thanks the PC for opening
his eyes to bigger picture and says, “You’ll always have a brother in me.” (If PC was very anti-Empire before,
maybe they had growth too, acknowledging some Imperials fought honorably. If PC was moderate or
Imperial-sympathizing, Ralof definitely changed because of them). 
The Thalmor threat is diminished for now: many agents were slain or chased off. Possibly one high-ranking
Thalmor (if Elenwen escaped or another) slunk away and might plot revenge (sequel hook). The campaign
could end on a note: Skyrim is free but must stand vigilant. 
Imperial Path – “Battle for Windhelm” & The Thalmor’s Last Stand
Prelude: General Tullius marshals the Legion for the final strike on Windhelm . This is it: Ulfric’s
stronghold, ancient city of Ysgramor . The Imperial army, bolstered by regained holds, travels to Eastmarch.
Tullius, though stoic, perhaps addresses his troops: “The rebellion ends today. We will show Ulfric and his
followers no quarter until they lay down their arms. But remember – the Thalmor would see us fight forever .
Let’s finish this with honor .” This acknowledges the recent revelations. He privately instructs the PCs on a
special task: to secure Ulfric Stormcloak alive if possible , because Titus Mede (the Emperor) may want him
for negotiation – and also to foil any Thalmor plan to martyr Ulfric. Legate Rikke agrees strongly; she’s Nord
and doesn’t relish killing a hero of her people, even if an enemy. Hadvar stands ready, resolved but
saddened (he’s likely lost friends on both sides by now). 37

Windhelm expects them. The city has thick snow, giving cover to approaches. Possibly a giant storm is
raging (either natural or maybe the Court Wizard does something). The Stormcloak camp inside is
prepared to fight to last. Ulfric likely gave a similar rousing speech to his men at the Palace of Kings: “If it is
to die today, we die for Skyrim!” There’s despair but determination. Notably, if Act III’s peace talk happened,
Ulfric might secretly instruct some loyalists: “If I fall, don’t continue senseless bloodshed; focus on Thalmor
infiltration in our land.” That could make some Stormcloaks less zealous, maybe surrender quicker if Ulfric is
down. But initially, they fight. 
Siege Start: Imperials attack the main gate of Windhelm. It’s a bone-chilling cold morning. Imperial
battering rams and mages blow through the wooden gates after heavy fighting. PCs could lead a scaling
operation – climb over an icy section of wall by the docks as a flanking maneuver . If they do, they might
encounter resistance from the Cruel-Sea family (a Windhelm family) defending their dock, which is an
interesting personal touch (maybe an old fisherman swinging an axe). They can try not to harm civilians,
etc. 
City Combat Highlights:
- Windhelm’s Stone Quarter becomes a battlefield. That includes the market and the revered statue of
Talos there. If an errant fireball knocks the Talos statue down, it’s symbolic – maybe saps Stormcloak morale
(their god’s effigy toppled) but could also anger them into berserking. PC could perhaps deliberately avoid
damaging it to show respect (if PC is Nord Imperial, they may order catapults to avoid the temple). That
could earn unexpected trust from some Stormcloaks who notice “the Empire soldiers didn’t defile Talos
shrine,” aiding surrender later .
- The Gray Quarter (Dunmer district) might stay out of it mostly; Dunmer residents hide. Possibly a Dunmer
group actually opens a side gate for Imperials (out of dislike for Ulfric’s rule) – a moral complication: the
Empire benefiting from the actions of an oppressed minority. PC could take advantage or not. Legate Rikke
might caution to be careful trusting them (not out of racism but fear of trap). But it could be genuine –
Dunmer just wanting the conflict over . If accepted, Imperials slip in through Grey Quarter , bypassing a
chokepoint, making fight easier . That should be seen as an act where the Empire did what Ulfric never did –
cooperate with Dunmer .
- The Palace of Kings stands at end, where Ulfric awaits. Stormcloaks form shield walls in (continued)
Imperial Victory Epilogue: General Tullius stands in the courtyard of the Palace of Kings, Windhelm’s
banners replaced by the Imperial Dragon. The civil war is over . Jarl Elisif is soon to be crowned High Queen
by the moot (with Imperial backing), promising to honor Nord traditions and restore the worship of Talos
in Skyrim – an open challenge to the Dominion, but a calculated one given the revelations of Thalmor
treachery. The Empire chooses to quietly overlook this breach of the Concordat, a sign of shifting winds. A
ceremony is held in Solitude, where High Queen Elisif and General Tullius honor the heroes of the war . The
PCs are lauded as “Heroes of Skyrim and the Empire” , their names to be sung by bards for generations.
They may receive formal titles – perhaps Thane of Windhelm (to help pacify that restive city) or even
governance of a hold as envoys of the Empire. In a moving gesture, Elisif presents the Shield of Solitude to
the lead PC, an ancient relic symbolizing the defense of the realm. 
Hadvar stands by in polished armor , newly promoted to Legate . His face is proud yet pensive. In a private
moment after the ceremony, Hadvar thanks the PCs: “We did it. Skyrim is unified again… under the Empire, yes,
but maybe now on our terms.” He touches the Talos amulet hidden beneath his collar and smiles – for the
White-Gold Concordat’s ban on Talos worship is effectively a dead letter in Skyrim now , an outcome
he’d quietly dreamed of. Hadvar’s arc concludes with him optimistic: he plans to help rebuild Skyrim’s
33

shattered villages and fortify against the Dominion. Perhaps he asks the PC to join him in training the new
generation of soldiers – ones who will be ready when the Dominion inevitably retaliates. His personal
Aspect “Devotion to Empire and Skyrim” has evolved – he now truly sees no difference between serving
his province and his Empire, as both strive together against the Thalmor . 
If Ralof survived the final battle, he is among the Stormcloak prisoners brought before Elisif. Many expect
harsh punishment, but Elisif, guided by the PC’s counsel, extends amnesty to most ordinary Stormcloak
soldiers. Ralof steps forward, defiantly expecting execution. Instead, Elisif thanks him for his bravery
defending Skyrim (even if misguided) and, in a surprising turn, offers him a place in the new guard of
Windhelm under the Empire. This is perhaps at the PC’s urging (a compel on Ralof’s “Proud Son of Skyrim”
to accept an honorable role over martyrdom). Ralof is stunned. After a long pause, he kneels and swears an
oath – not to the Empire directly, but “to the protection of the people of Skyrim, against all who threaten us.”
Elisif accepts this wording. Ralof’s eyes meet the PC’s; there’s a mix of gratitude and lingering sorrow. His
war is over , and though his side lost, he has found a new purpose free of Ulfric’s shadow. In his heart, Ralof’s
hatred has shifted entirely toward the Thalmor – and perhaps, one day, he and Hadvar will stand side by
side when the next war comes. Their personal feud buried, Ralof even clasps Hadvar’s forearm in the old
Nord manner , a gesture of hard-won respect. 
The Thalmor , for now, have been utterly exposed and routed from Skyrim. Any captured Thalmor agents
(like Ondolemar or Elenwen, if alive) are delivered in chains to the High Queen’s court. It’s decided (perhaps
by Imperial-PC influence) that these prisoners will be kept as leverage rather than executed – a move that
gives the Empire diplomatic cards to play and denies the Dominion new martyrs. In secret, General Tullius
sends word to the Emperor about the Thalmor’s orchestrations , accompanied by the evidence the
PCs obtained. The Empire’s high leadership is forced to reckon with the uncomfortable truth that
appeasing the Dominion nearly destroyed Skyrim. There are quiet but significant shifts in policy: the Empire
begins covertly rearming for an eventual war with the Aldmeri Dominion, and Talos worship is increasingly
tolerated even outside Skyrim. While the White-Gold Concordat isn’t officially overturned, the Emperor
tacitly permits Skyrim (and its veterans) to honor Talos – a morale boost to the populace and a subtle
rebuke to the Thalmor . The PCs’ actions in revealing the Thalmor plot have thus not only saved Skyrim but
begun to change the course of the Empire itself. 
In the aftermath, fate point economy in the narrative: each PC likely gains a cache of Fate Points
symbolically – they are flush with renown and goodwill after the war . The GM can highlight a few lingering
open aspects to tie off: e.g., “Maven Black-Briar’s Ambitions” – if the PC struck deals with her , note that
under Elisif’s reign Maven’s influence is checked (perhaps the PC ensured Maven was kept on a short leash
in Riften in exchange for past cooperation). “Forsworn Resurgence” – now that the war is done, the new
leadership might finally address Reachmen grievances (the PC could spearhead a diplomatic approach,
turning a former side enemy into an ally against Thalmor). These are seeds the PC can influence in epilogue
scenes, leveraging their new station to resolve Skyrim’s internal conflicts more justly. 
Finally, as the PCs depart Windhelm on their journey back to Solitude or wherever they choose to settle, a
shadow passes over the sun – the silhouette of a dragon . For a moment, weapons are raised in alarm.
But the dragon (it could be Odahviing or another freed dragon) simply circles and heads off into the
northern mountains. A voice familiar to the PCs – the Dragonborn – hails them from a nearby outlook
where he stands with a smile. He gives a respectful nod and perhaps shouts a single word of the Thu’um in
their honor – not a destructive Shout, but one of glory and victory that echoes across the skies. (If a
translation is needed, Arngeir later explains it was the Old Nord word for “Unity.” ) It’s a final salute from one3424

living legend to the new heroes of Skyrim. “This land endures because of heroes like you,” the Dragonborn
says quietly (or leaves carved on a tablet if one prefers a subtler cameo). “Kaal do sahrot Heim” – ’Carry on
the greatness of the Home.’* With that, the Dragonborn departs on the dragon’s back, heading into his own
next adventure, leaving the PCs to their well-earned chapter in history. 
Conclusion: Skyrim’s New Dawn
The civil war has ended, but the campaign’s true finale is the transformation of Skyrim’s spirit. If
Stormcloaks prevailed , Skyrim stands free – battered but unbowed, guided by High King Ulfric (or his
successors) who now temper pride with wisdom. The Moot convenes and, under the PC’s counsel,
formalizes a policy of vigilance against the Thalmor above all. Nords, Dunmer , and other peoples of Skyrim
begin mending rifts. Perhaps the PC is present when Ulfric makes a surprising conciliatory gesture – like
commissioning a monument in Windhelm to honor “all sons and daughters of Skyrim” , including those
who fought against him, emphasizing that they are one people now. The themes of identity and
patriotism reach full circle: no longer defined by hatred of the Empire, Skyrim’s identity reforms around
protecting its sovereignty and way of life from true tyrants (the Dominion). Tragedy gives way to hope as
families reunite across battle lines – a poignant scene might be the PC witnessing a pair of soldiers from
opposite sides, now both discharged, lighting a candle together for fallen comrades of both armies. Fate
Core mechanics wise, many negative aspects (like “Civil Unrest” in each hold) can be removed as the
narrative conditions have been addressed by PC actions, while new aspects like “Pride of the Unified
Skyrim” apply, granting the land a bonus to resist outside threats (and granting PCs narrative justification
for greater resources when facing external conflicts). The PC, perhaps taking up a Jarlship or advising Ulfric,
can use their accumulated Fate Points (and goodwill) to shape policies – for instance, compelling Ulfric’s
“True Son of Skyrim” aspect to persuade him to allow a representative Moot to give all holds a voice in
governance, thereby avoiding future succession crises. Ulfric, influenced by the PC, might agree – a legacy
of ideological growth born from the campaign. 
If Imperials prevailed , Skyrim remains within the Empire – but changed. The Empire, humbled by how
close it came to losing Skyrim, grants the province greater autonomy in practice. High Queen Elisif forms a
new Skyrim Council including former rebels and neutrals (perhaps the PC chairs it) to address grievances
in each hold. The moral conflicts of the war yield reforms: for example, the persecution of the Forsworn is
officially ended; Elisif (advised by the PC who recalls Markarth’s lessons) issues an edict pardoning Forsworn
fighters and inviting a summit in Markarth to negotiate peace – a use of Diplomacy by the PC on a national
scale. The PC might travel one last time to Understone Keep to oversee this meeting between Silver-Blood
representatives and Forsworn elders, resolving that long-standing intrigue with a treaty (perhaps even
involving a Fate Challenge with social rolls to calm hostilities – success yielding an Aspect “Peace in The
Reach” on the epilogue, failure meaning a simmering insurgency remains but reduced). Meanwhile, Talos
worship resumes openly – when the Thalmor angrily protest, the Empire (backed by evidence the PC
provided of Dominion misdeeds) refuses to enforce the ban, effectively nullifying that hated clause. The
White-Gold Concordat is left in tatters; the Dominion must either swallow this defiance or reveal its weak
hand post-war . A brief scene might show a Thalmor dignitary departing Elisif’s court in a fury – a victory not
just martial but ideological for the Nords. Ordinary citizens begin to see the Empire in a more positive light,
not as overlords but as fellow victors against deception. 
In both outcomes, the PCs’ personal stories conclude with them at the center of Skyrim’s future. They have
become more than soldiers or adventurers – they are statesmen, peacemakers, and champions whose
decisions shape the political and spiritual landscape. Importantly, they carry the weight of the campaign’s

themes: identity, ideology, tragedy, patriotism, and moral conflict . They have forged an identity for Skyrim that
transcended the simple dichotomy of Empire vs. Stormcloak – forging instead a narrative of Skyrim united
against the true evils of the world . The tragedy of brother fighting brother is recorded in harrowing detail by
the Bards College (with which the PC might collaborate to ensure a truthful, healing account). Patriotism
remains, but wiser – the PC might establish, for instance, a memorial in Whiterun , on the very plains where
the war’s first full battle was fought. At its base, an inscription reads: “May future sons and daughters of
Skyrim remember: our blood is one when faced with the night.” This directly acknowledges the pain (blood
spilled) and the ultimate lesson (unity against darkness). 
In a final cinematic vignette, perhaps months later , the High King/Queen (Ulfric or Elisif) holds a grand
moot or gathering at High Hrothgar – this time not for war , but for a celebration of Skyrim . Representatives
from every hold, every faction – Companions, College mages, even a reformed Thieves Guild envoy – attend.
The PCs stand at the High King/Queen’s side as honored heroes. A great horn (clock) is sounded (or a
metaphoric Fate “scene aspect” is invoked): “The Dragonborn’s Oath” – that all in attendance swear to
defend Skyrim together against any threat. The Greybeards bless the gathering with a deep resonant
“LAAS” (meaning “life” in the dragon tongue) which echoes warmly. As mead is raised and old enemies
clasp hands, the camera (so to speak) pans upward out of the hall to the clear sky above. The aurora dances
over Skyrim, vibrant and peaceful, no longer torn by war . In that sky, for a keen eye, a flash of scale and
wing might be seen – dragons still circle the world, but for now, the land of Skyrim knows peace , hard-
won and well-deserved. 
Campaign Module Conclusion: The Fate Core mechanics throughout have enabled epic narratives: PCs
managed extended conflicts with countdowns (like siege progress clocks and Thalmor schemes) and felt
the weight of Consequences that carried from Act to Act (Ulfric’s poisoned wound, Ralof’s crisis of faith,
cities bearing aspects of unrest). They invoked Aspects like “True Unity” in the final moments to turn
potential tragedy into alliance. The GM should reward players with additional Fate Points for resolving
major story arcs – these can translate into lasting character Aspects on their sheets reflecting their legacy.
For example, a PC might take Aspect: “Hero of the Skyrim Civil War” or “Voice of Reconciliation” –
something that could influence any future adventures in Tamriel, marking them as a major figure. NPCs like
Hadvar and Ralof have grown from simple soldiers to nuanced friends whose personal journeys (their
psychological profiles of loyalty, doubt, and growth) reached fulfilling conclusions at the climax of Act IV,
largely thanks to the PCs’ interventions and the compels that drew out their deepest conflicts. 
The final scene belongs to the players. As the new dawn’s light breaks over the Throat of the World,
painting the snow-capped peaks in gold, the PCs gather perhaps on the steps of High Hrothgar or at the
gates of Solitude/Windhelm. They reflect on the long road from Alduin’s epilogue to this moment. They
recall the battles won and lost, the friends made and fallen. They stand now not as Stormcloak or Imperial ,
not as outsider or native , but as Skyrim’s champions . In this moment of hard-earned peace, allow each
player to narrate a short epilogue for their character: one might describe how they will take up the jarl’s
mantle and lead their hold with wisdom, another how they found a quiet farmstead to finally raise a
family, hanging up their sword except when duty calls again. One may plan to go dragon-hunting with the
Dragonborn , seeking new horizons with a certain gleam of adventure in their eyes (the open-ended future).
Encourage them to tie their epilogues to their aspects and consequences resolved : e.g., a PC with
“Haunted by War” might narrate how they build a veterans’ hall in Whiterun to counsel other soldiers,
turning that trouble into a positive Aspect “Healer of War’s Wounds” .

As a GM closing note , you might address the players out-of-character: congratulate them on steering the
fate of Skyrim and note how their choices led to this specific ending. In Fate Core style, highlight a few “Fate
Points well spent” – the clutch invoke that prevented Ulfric’s assassination, the compel that had Ralof see
reason, etc., reinforcing how their creative play truly shaped the story. This reinforces that in Fate (and in
this campaign), the players’ agency and the story’s outcome are entwined . 
The skalds will craft sagas of these events. The “Campaign Aspects” that defined this module – Civil War,
Hidden Thalmor Menace, Ideals in Conflict – have been resolved: the Civil War ended, the Thalmor menace
unmasked and largely driven out, and the ideals (both Nordic freedom and Imperial unity) reconciled into a
new, stronger theme: Hope for Tomorrow . The final image in the module might be an illustration of the
PCs standing atop the Throat of the World at sunrise, cloaks fluttering, gazing out over the unified province
they helped forge – a truly cinematic end. 
Thus ends the Skyrim Civil War Campaign. The land’s fate is secured, for now, by the players’ hands. The
Game Master is encouraged to continue the story if desired – perhaps segueing into post-war intrigues or
the looming Great War with the Dominion – but as a self-contained saga, this campaign concludes with
Skyrim entering a new era of dawn. The bards sing a final verse:
“From Whiterun’s flames to Solitude’s sun,
Our heroes fought ’til peace was won.
Stormcloak courage and Imperial grace,
Together struck the Aldmeri base.
Talos smiles upon our land,
Freed from hatred, hand in hand.
By fate’s design and heroes’ end,
Skyrim stands, unbroken – to defend.”
This is the legacy of the PCs – a legacy that will guide Skyrim when the next storm comes, and one that
turns war’s tragic end into the promise of a united, stronger tomorrow. The final Fate Point is awarded to
each player as the credits roll – for they have truly earned the title “Saviors of Skyrim.”
~ FIN ~
GM Tips and Campaign Retrospective: (below are additional notes for the GM to consider after running the
campaign)
Player-Driven Outcomes: This module provided numerous branching paths and optional scenes
(like the High Hrothgar peace council) that can drastically alter the tone of the ending. Embrace the
outcome your players steer toward. If they opted for uncompromising victory instead of
reconciliation, frame the ending accordingly – perhaps a harsher but stable regime, and note that
Consequences (like lingering rebel sympathies or embittered populaces) may persist as aspects into
future play. Conversely, if they somehow brokered peace without a final battle, let that stand as their
triumph (maybe Ulfric and Elisif forming a joint moot because of the PCs) – a rarer outcome but
within Fate’s flexibility. Every ending should address the campaign’s core conflicts as resolved, one
way or another , to feel satisfying. 13

Integrating Fate Mechanics in Final Sessions: In the climactic scenes, many aspects were in play –
encourage players to use their Fate Points to invoke those cinematic details. For example, in the final
duel, a player could invoke Ulfric’s “Thalmor’s Unwitting Pawn” aspect (exposed in his dossier) to
hit him with an emotional argument instead of a sword – possibly taking him out of the conflict by
compelling surrender rather than dealing a killing blow. Likewise, the final battle clocks (like the
Thalmor’s assassination countdown) can be represented physically on paper for players to see,
heightening tension (“3 boxes left until Elenwen reaches Ulfric – what do you do?!”). The players’
quick thinking and use of Create Advantage actions (like rigging a bridge to collapse or rallying
troops with a rousing speech) should be encouraged and rewarded, as these can dramatically swing
the large-scale conflict in Fate’s narrative system. 
NPC Fate Point Uses: Remember that major NPCs (Ulfric, Tullius, etc.) have their own pools to
spend. You demonstrated this when Ulfric perhaps invoked “The Sons of Skyrim are my strength”
to boost his troops or when Tullius compelled “By the Book” on himself to initially insist on Ulfric’s
execution. In the final sessions, using these NPC Fate actions lets the players feel the weight of these
legendary figures, but by Act IV the players likely have more Fate Points and narrative control –
appropriately, as the climax is their story to finish. 
Aftermath and Sequel Hooks: The module leaves room for further adventures. If a campaign were
to continue, you could carry forward unresolved threads as aspects on the world. For instance,
“Unfinished Business of the Thalmor” could be an aspect signaling that while Thalmor influence is
curbed, agents still lurk (the PCs might hunt them down in a sequel). “Skyrim Reborn, But…” might
denote an issue like economic strain or a resurgence of dragons (if running concurrently with the
Dragonborn’s timeline) – giving a new storyline. Provide Fate Points to players when these world
aspects complicate their peacetime life (e.g., a compel that a Thalmor assassin seeks revenge on a
PC dignitary, dragging them into a cloak-and-dagger duel in the new court). 
Character Advancement: By campaign’s end, consider allowing players to rewrite one of their
aspects or swap a stunt to reflect their growth. Perhaps a PC’s “Vindictive Patriot” trouble no longer
applies after they learned mercy – they might change it to “Protective Patriot” or an entirely
different trouble like “Burdened by Expectations of Leadership” if they took on a ruling role. This
solidifies the campaign’s long-term impact on their personal identities. 
The Skyrim Civil War Fate Campaign is now concluded, with the players having authored a new chapter in
Elder Scrolls lore through collaborative storytelling and Fate Core’s dynamic mechanics. As a Game Master ,
take a moment to commend the group: they navigated complex plots of war , intrigue, and moral choice,
and emerged not just as stronger characters but as part of Skyrim’s living history. In the end, the world of
Tamriel is a little changed by their deeds – and should any dark clouds gather again on the horizon
(whether Daedric princes scheming or the drums of the Dominion’s armies), the heroes of this saga stand
ready, fate tokens in hand , to face whatever comes with courage and honor .
