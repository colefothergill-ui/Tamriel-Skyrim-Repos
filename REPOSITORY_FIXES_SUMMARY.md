# Repository Polish and Debug Summary

## Date: 2026-01-06

This document summarizes all fixes and improvements made to the Tamriel-Skyrim-Repos repository to resolve errors and polish the codebase for use with ChatGPT and other AI tools for TTRPG sessions.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSON Structure Issues

#### state/campaign_state.json
- **Issue**: Duplicate entry for "Balgruuf the Greater" in the allies list (appeared twice: as "Balgruuf the Greater (conditional)" and "Balgruuf the Greater")
- **Fix**: Consolidated to single entry: "Balgruuf the Greater"
- **Issue**: Duplicate flags sections (both `major_flags` and `flags` with same content but inconsistent values)
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate `flags` section, kept only `major_flags` with correct values

#### state/campaign_position.json
- **Issue**: `current_act` was a string "ACT_1" instead of an integer
- **Fix**: Changed to integer `1` for consistency with validation scripts and default expectations

### 2. Banned Terms in Documentation

Removed erroneous references to "World of Warcraft" and "BFA Module" from converted PDF files. These were artifacts from the PDF-to-markdown conversion process that included unrelated file references.

**Files cleaned:**
- `modules/acts/ACT_04_THE_FINAL_STORM.md`
- `source_material/converted_pdfs/elder-scrolls-skyrim-fate-core-campaign-module-pdf.md`
- `factions/modules/acts/ACT_04_THE_FINAL_STORM.md`
- `factions/source_material/converted_pdfs/elder-scrolls-skyrim-fate-core-campaign-module-pdf.md`

### 3. Python Script Error Handling

Enhanced error handling in critical scripts to prevent crashes when JSON files are malformed or missing:

**scripts/dragonbreak_cue.py**
- Added try-catch blocks for JSON parsing errors
- Now returns `None` instead of crashing on invalid JSON
- Provides warning messages for debugging

**scripts/secret_turn_check.py**
- Added comprehensive error handling for file operations
- Returns empty dict on errors instead of crashing
- Provides informative warning messages

**scripts/on_track.py**
- Added error handling for JSON parsing
- Gracefully handles missing or malformed files
- Provides helpful warning messages

## Validation Results

All repository validation scripts now pass successfully:

### ✅ validate_state.py
```
OK: state and clocks look consistent.
```

### ✅ custom_scan.py
```
VALIDATION PASSED: Repository is clean
```

### ✅ audit_vault.sh
All checks passed:
- Custom scan for banned terms: ✅
- Old clock references: ✅
- JSON file integrity: ✅
- Story module completeness: ✅

### ✅ All JSON Files
- All JSON files validated with `python -m json.tool`
- No syntax errors found

### ✅ Python Scripts
- All Python scripts tested and working correctly
- No syntax errors
- Proper error handling implemented

## Scripts Tested and Verified

1. **validate_state.py** - Validates campaign state and clocks
2. **custom_scan.py** - Scans for banned terms
3. **on_track.py** - Checks campaign alignment with module rails
4. **dragonbreak_cue.py** - Detects Dragonbreak moment eligibility
5. **secret_turn_check.py** - Evaluates Secret Turn eligibility
6. **build_context.py** - Builds GM context pack
7. **session_stamp.py** - Creates timestamped session logs
8. **first_run.py** - First-time onboarding experience
9. **audit_vault.sh** - Comprehensive vault integrity check
10. **setup_aliases.sh** - Sets up bash aliases

---

## What Was NOT Changed

The following were intentionally left unchanged as they represent valid campaign state:

- **Campaign progression**: The campaign has progressed beyond Session Zero (scene is S3_GATEHOUSE_PURGE_POST_DUEL), which is correct
- **PC creation**: Character "Eltric Stagborne" is properly created
- **Folder structure**: No restructuring of the directory tree
- **Core module content**: No changes to campaign narrative or mechanics
- **Clocks and flags**: Campaign progress preserved

---

## Recommendations for Use

### For ChatGPT Sessions

The repository is now ready for use with ChatGPT. To get started:

1. **First-time setup**: Run `python scripts/first_run.py` for guided onboarding
2. **Before each session**: Run `python scripts/build_context.py` to get current state
3. **Session creation**: Use `python scripts/session_stamp.py` to create new log files
4. **Validation**: Run `bash scripts/audit_vault.sh` periodically to check integrity

### Quick Health Check

Run these commands to verify repository health:
```bash
python scripts/validate_state.py
python scripts/custom_scan.py
```

Both should pass without errors.
