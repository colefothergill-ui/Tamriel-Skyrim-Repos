## Chapter 1: The Seal of the Dragon
Dracon’o Belore—“The Dragon of the Sun”—was the pride of House Dragonsun, a runic amulet whispered to be blessed by Malygos. Lord Ama’thar Dragonsun carried it as Grand Magister of Quel’thalas, blending blade and spell until trolls and hexes alike broke before him. But the artifact whispered *possibility*, and Ama’thar’s legend curdled into entitlement. In secret, he tried to fuse the Sunwell’s essence into the amulet—to “seal the dragon and become its master.”

Malygos answered with a bloodline curse: Dracon’o Belore became both conduit and siphon. The Dragonsun were born with hunger, and a living seal—**Dracon’Thor’reth**—that could flare into bestial strength and ravenous thirst when denied.

## Chapter 2: The Seal That Blotted the Sun
Farstriders arrived under Anasterian’s grim authority. Ama’thar refused exile until his daughter **Chasiel** stopped him, not with force, but with a plea that carried across the terrace overlooking the Sunwell. Ama’thar surrendered Dracon’o Belore into her hands and whispered: “Seal it. Seal me.”

That night, Chasiel renamed the house **Dragonseal** and entombed the relic beneath warded stone. Ama’thar left Silvermoon under escort and never returned. For centuries, Dragonseal earned redemption the hard way: service, discipline, lives saved instead of titles claimed.

## Chapter 3: Virtues of the Sun, Sealed in Suroe
Suroe grew up bruised, proud, and allergic to bullies. Chasiel guided him toward discipline: Spellbreaker doctrine, anti-magic steel, and training until palms bled and the mind learned stillness. He rose fast, earned command, and learned pride that was *real*.

Chasiel then placed him among exemplars of Duty and Honor—Halduron Brightwing and Lor’themar Theron. Campaign after campaign built the early legend of Suroe Dragonseal… and the danger of believing it.

## Chapter 4: Seal Their Fate
When the Sunwell fell, the hunger the seal had kept at a simmer became wildfire. Dragonseal wards failed. Kin broke—some became wretched, others monsters, others simply vanished into ruin. The house’s numbers collapsed in a season.

Suroe fought through it like a man carrying a burning altar: protecting civilians, dragging kin from collapse, holding jaws shut when desperation became teeth.

When Kael’thas offered survival through fel and Outland, Suroe went—not because he believed the dream, but because he feared what he would become if he stayed.

## Chapter 5: Ashes of Outland, Fire in the Blood
Outland weaponized the curse. Fel was a bridge for many blood elves; for Suroe it was a mirror. He fought as a disciplined catastrophe and drew the appraisal of **Grand Magister Rommath**, whose honesty cut deeper than flattery: sheath the hunger or be sheathed by it.

Suroe returned for the Sunwell Plateau crisis. He did not win in a heroic song—he fought through wreckage, ended the lie, and helped stop the ritual. When the Sunwell was purified, he expected relief. He got withdrawal. Fel does not leave politely, and the seal amplified craving into a daily internal war.

---

## Chapter 6: The Quiet Dragon
Suroe found a different answer under Pandaria’s sky: breath, chi, discipline not fed by mana. **Taran Zhu** named the truth: survival is not control. Monk training didn’t “cure” the seal—it created space between hunger and action.

Suroe earned his place among the Shado-Pan by refusing to become what addiction wanted. By Legion’s aftermath, he returned to Quel’thalas as something rare: a Spellbreaker who could quell magic without being consumed by it.

He came home with the seal still in his blood.

But for the first time since Ama’thar’s folly, the seal felt like a dragon learning it had a rider.

## Fate Hooks (Invokes & Compels)
**Invoke ideas**
- “I’ve seen what hunger does. I choose discipline.” (resist temptation, protect civilians)
- “Signal chains break like bones.” (anti-coordination tactics, disrupting command/control)
- “Earned pride, not inherited myth.” (leadership, inspiring troops)

**Compel ideas**
- The seal flares under deprivation → reckless escalation unless you spend/earn control
- Reputation precedes you → enemies plan specifically for your style (counterplay)
- Rommath’s interest → political pressure, secrecy demands, uncomfortable bargains
