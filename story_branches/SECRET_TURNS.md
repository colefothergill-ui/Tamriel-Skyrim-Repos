# Secret Turns — Elder Scrolls Moment (Option 6)

A Secret Turn is an optional “mythic thread” opportunity that may appear at decision points.

## When to offer Option 6
Offer Option 6 ONLY if at least one condition is true:
- A major clock crosses a threshold (e.g., Thalmor Influence ≥ 3)
- An act clock is halfway or more
- A faction clock is 1 tick from a milestone
- The current location is ancient / mythic / hidden (ruins, barrows, Dwemer, forbidden shrines)

## What Option 6 does
- Reveals a clue, hidden mechanism, prophecy scrap, artifact whisper, agent slip, or cursed omen
- Creates an Aspect / new hook / new clock tick
- Never mandatory; always risky/tempting

## Seeds (TODO)
- Markarth Abandoned House: doors slam + disembodied taunt (Molag Bal vibe) (TODO triggers)
- TODO
