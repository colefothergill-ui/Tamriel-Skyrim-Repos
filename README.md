# WoW BFA Fate Core — Canon Vault (GitHub-ready)

This repo is a **living canon vault** for your campaign: searchable, versioned, and easy to feed into ChatGPT via the GitHub connector.

## What goes where
- **/modules/** — reference PDFs converted to Markdown (campaign modules, setting docs)
- **/npcs/** — NPC dossiers / personal questlines converted to Markdown
- **/logs/** — session logs (“Save Game” recaps) you write after play
- **/clocks/** — single source of truth for clocks (numbers live here)
- **/volumes/** — long-form chapterized story logs, organized by volume

## Workflow (no coding)
1. After a session, create a new file in `/logs/` using `session_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Update clock numbers in `/clocks/bfa_clocks.json`.
3. Commit changes with a short message (e.g., “Session 06: Rommath trust +1, Warfront tick”).
